## Background

We live in a microbial world with enormous genetic diversity and yet humanity’s relationship with microbes has been primarily adversarial, shaped by a small number of pathogenic species. As part of a [National Research Foundation Investigatorship](https://www.nrf.gov.sg/grants/nrfi/) grant to the lab, we are developing **high-throughput techniques to isolate and study microbial diversity** from a range of environmental (e.g. soil, sewage etc) and human samples (e.g. stool, saliva etc). We will combine single-cell dispensing technologies, genome-resolved metagenomics, flow-cytometry and raman spectroscopy to functionally interrogate strains, study microbial interactions and build in silico models of community assembly. Our goals are to identify microbes and their functions that contribute to **colonization resistance in the gut and the environment against multi-drug resistant bacteria**.


## Qualifications

- PhD in Culturomics
- Strong publication track record
- Candidates with significant experience in technology development will be preferred
