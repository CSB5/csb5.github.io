## Background

[Project GLOW](https://www.npm.sg/glow-gut-linked-outcomes-in-wellbeing/) is part of the national precision medicine program in Singapore with a focus on microbiome and mental health. This will be a population-scale study (>5,000 study participants), leveraging the **latest advances in long-read metagenomics** (PacBio HiFi, ONT, CycloneSeq etc) and **untargeted metabolomics**, as well as host multi-omics datasets and deep phenotyping (particularly mental health-related) to study how gut microbes may impact our mental well-being. This will also be an opportunity to **develop the next-generation of computational methods for genome-resolved metagenomics**, intra-host diversity analysis, strain-level phenotypic associations, metagenome-scale metabolic modelling and host-microbe interaction studies.


## Qualifications

- **PhD in Computational Metagenomics**
- Strong publication track record
- Candidates with significant experience in algorithm development will be preferred

## How to Apply

Please e-mail your CV (with contact details of 2 or more referees) and a statement of research interests (1-2 pages) to Prof Niranjan Nagarajan ([niranjan@nus.edu.sg](mailto:niranjan@nus.edu.sg)). Short-listed candidates will be contacted via e-mail for interviews in Q1 2026.
