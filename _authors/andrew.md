I'm a microbiology enthusiast with a strong interest in bacterial culturing and microscopy, looking at the tiny details that reveal big stories. In the lab, I mainly focus on isolating bacteriophages, applying my skills to uncover new aspects of microbial life. Outside the lab, I enjoy photography, where I channel the same appreciation for structure, contrast, and perspective.
