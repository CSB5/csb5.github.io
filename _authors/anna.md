My background is primarily in cancer research, and I have recently transitioned into the exciting and rapidly evolving field of microbiome research. This shift has opened up new opportunities for me to explore emerging scientific frontiers. Currently, I’m focused on setting up a new lab at NUS, laying the foundation for future research and collaborative projects. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, baking, travelling, and spending quality time with family and friends.
