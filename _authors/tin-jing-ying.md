My work focuses on using high-throughput techniques to uncover and study microbial species. With countless species still waiting to be discovered, it’s truly exciting to contribute to efforts that expand our understanding of the hidden diversity of microbial communities. Outside the lab, I enjoy spending time with friends and family over good food and conversation.
