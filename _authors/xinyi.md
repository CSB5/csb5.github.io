**BSc (Hons)** &nbsp;&nbsp; / &nbsp;&nbsp; National University of Singapore<br>

<br/>

I am a PhD student passionate about pursuing atopic dermatitis and skin microbiome research. Ultimately, I hope to be able to bring research closer to people, contributing to research in these areas, and eventually working towards better treatment and diagnostic tools for atopic dermatitis. Apart from research, I enjoy dancing, watching shows (in my Japanese and Chinese animation phase currently), gaming, reading, and travelling.
