**BSc** &nbsp;&nbsp; / &nbsp;&nbsp; Chulalongkorn University<br>

<br/>

I am a PhD student at National University of Singapore with a strong passion in bioinformatics, particularly in the areas of antimicrobial resistance and precision medicine. My goal is to contribute to research and development, creating a positive impact in the community! Aside from research, I love spending time with my family, watching korean series, and playing online games.
