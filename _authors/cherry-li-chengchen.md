I am a PhD candidate passionate about understanding and leveraging microbiome-based science to advance epidemiology, technology transfer, and public health practice. My current research focuses on mining population-based cohort data to unravel the role of skin microbiome in skin health, with the ultimate goal to translate these insights into skincare and therapeutics. Outside of research, I enjoy brewing coffee (meticuously, with a weight scale and a timer) and hiphop dancing.
