I am interested in biotech developments for healthcare and sustainability and how to make biotech translatable. I now work with Minghao on spatial metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, and previously worked on nanopore sequencing and CRISPR. I am seated at (in charge of) the lab's snack table. My life consists of family&friends time-spending, weddings going, portraits painting, novels reading, marathons training, cats&dogs whispering... I also really like sloths.
