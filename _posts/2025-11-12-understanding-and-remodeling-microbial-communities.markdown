title: "Understanding and remodeling microbial communities"
description: Our limited understanding of microbial community assembly and function prevents us from effectively designing them for therapeutic and biotechnological use. We are the first to propose a systematic deconstruct-model-reconstruct strategy aimed at uncovering the rules of microbial community assembly, with the goal of using this knowledge to prevent antimicrobial-resistant pathogen reservoirs.

# Introduction
Microorganisms, with over a million species shaped by 4 billion years of evolution, form complex communities that are still poorly understood. Recent advances, including genome-resolved metagenomics and high-throughput single-cell isolation, offer the potential to deconstruct human and environmental microbial communities into their constituent strains and genomes. However, predictive reconstruction of microbial ecosystems to suppress pathogens has not yet been achieved. Studies have shown that microbial communities, both human and environmental, exhibit unique structures influenced by the functions of specific strains. By harnessing these strains, it may be possible to create experimental models that mimic real community dynamics, enabling the validation of in silico predictions for microbial functions that can inhibit multiple pathogenic species.

# Objectives

We aim to understand the organization of microbial communities to restore ecological functions and reduce human and environmental reservoirs of AMR pathogens through the following three objectives in a **Deconstruct–Model–Reconstruct** framework:

1. **Deconstruct complex microbial communities into constituent strains, genomes, and functions**
   - Combine whole-genome sequencing from metagenomics with high-throughput microbial single-cell isolation.
   - Aim to obtain strains, genomes, and functional data for the community members.
   - This approach leverages our expertise in genome-resolved metagenomics, enabling the comprehensive study of microbial interactions (Aim 2).

1. **Model ecological rules of community assembly via high-throughput combinatorial culturing**
   - Use data from equilibrium community configurations across thousands of bacterial combinations to learn models of microbial community assembly.
   - Leverage cutting-edge tools and protocols for high-throughput combinatorial competition experiments and AI-extended models.
   - Enable the development of personalized models for testing microbial interventions (Aim 3).

1. **Reconstruct stable community configurations in vitro and in vivo that inhibit multiple pathogens**
   - Reconstruct microbial communities that mimic natural ecosystems’ ability to suppress pathogenic species (with abundance <0.1%).
   - Identify key microbial functions and products that can predict pathogen colonization risk, leading to preventive or prophylactic biotherapeutics.
   - Inform environmental cleaning strategies to reduce microbial burden without disrupting anti-pathogen functions.
   - Validate these models to enable wider applications in engineering microbial communities for biotherapeutic and biotechnological purposes.
