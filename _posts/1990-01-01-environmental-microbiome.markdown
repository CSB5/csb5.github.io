Emerging evidence suggests that the very strategies that we use to sanitize our environments might be selecting for dangerous pathogens. Our studies have unraveled the striking enrichment of multi-drug resistant bacteria in hospital environment, the distribution of AMR and ESKAPE pathogens in Singapore’s [hawker centers](/hawker-centre-surveillance), and in ongoing work we are shedding light on microbes in Singapore’s [border checkpoints](/metaborders) (land, sea, air).
