Emerging evidence suggests that the very strategies that we use to sanitize our environments might be selecting for dangerous pathogens. Our studies have unraveled the striking enrichment of multi-drug resistant bacteria in hospital environment (cite, in collaboration with the global MetaSUB consortium), the distribution of AMR and ESKAPE pathogens in Singapore’s hawker centers (cite), and in ongoing work we are shedding light on microbes in Singapore’s border checkpoints (land, sea, air, link).
