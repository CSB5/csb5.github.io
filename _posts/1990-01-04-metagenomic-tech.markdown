The ecology and function of the unseen microbial world is hard to study because of its scale and complexity. We develop [wet-lab](/understanding-and-remodeling-microbial-communities) and [dry-lab](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0191-2) technologies that unravel microbial genetic diversity and function at the whole-genome and systems level. Our mission is to build predictive [AI models](/prepare) that can help us design synthetic communities with new functions.
