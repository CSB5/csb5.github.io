How does the gut microbiome evolve as we grow older? Are certain microbes consistently enriched or depleted with age, and do these shifts correspond to functional changes in how our microbiome works?  

To address these questions, we performed shotgun metagenomics on one of the largest healthy aging cohorts in Asia with over 200 octogenarians. The results revealed a remarkably consistent pattern of microbial change across the aging spectrum and surprising functional expansions. Sounds exciting? Read on ...

We found a progressive shift in microbiome composition with age, particularly along the y=x axis relative to the first and second principal components of variation.

This shift was driven by a reduction in microbial richness, evenness and Shannon diversity, an observation which was found only in few other cohorts.

At species level, we found major butyrate-producing species are depleted with age (*F. prausnitzii*, *Roseburia*) and instead an alternate pathway with microbial biosynthesis of lysine & conversion to butyrate (*Bacteroides* & *Alistipes* species) appears enriched.

Interestingly, these microbial co-occurrence networks differ quite strikingly between elderly and the young groups, with a shared pattern of cliques formed by the usual butyrate producers and Alistipes species.

Further, at the microbial pathway level, we observed an expansion in the metabolic potential of butyrate synthesis pathways, particularly from L-lysine precursors.

Congruently, (meta)Genome assemblies further confirmed this metabolic potential expansion where it showed many genomes of *Bacteroides* and *Alistipes* species harbor complete pathways for lysine biosynthesis & metabolic network analysis showed that lysine-to-butyrate conversion are reachable.

Finally, the scale and depth of our cohort allowed us to uncover several associations between specific microbial taxa and host phenotypes relevant to healthy aging—insights that could help identify microbial markers or even modulators of long-term health.

Our study is one of the largest gut microbiome analyses in Asian octogenarians, highlighting key microbes involved in healthy aging.
