Until further discoveries, antibiotics remain essential components to rescue ourselves from harmful bacteria. Their recurrent usage is, however, well known to be linked to a global resistance, reducing in fine their benefit. It is therefore crucial to build a comprehensive understanding of how antibiotics affect the human body and how different antibiotics or modes of administration can lead to similar or different results. Such knowledge can guide more judicious use, improving patient care while helping to limit overall antibiotic consumption.

The impact of antibiotics on the gut microbiome has been investigated for decades. Beyond eliminating their intended pathogens, most antibiotics are known to exert broad collateral effects, damaging many beneficial gut microbes and inducing a "dysbiosis" state, when one gut microbiome becomes unstable and usually requires weeks to months to recover. Although extensive efforts have been made to characterize the global effect of antibiotic usage, the limited scope obtainable with traditional sequencing methods has hindered the details behind the gut microbiome adaptations to different kinds of antibiotics.

Leveraging a new longitudinal cohort in Singapore obtained in collaboration with our partners from the Tan Tock Seng Hospital and National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), we plan to obtain a brand new picture of how the microbiome is impacted and responds to antibiotics. We will utilize high-quality long-read sequencing data to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the ecological and evolutionary responses to antibiotic use. This project offers exciting research opportunities with new ways to explore the metagenomes, both functionally (which microbes do what), ecologically (what is the exact composition of the microbiome, now even at the strain level), and genetically (how are genomes evolving under different circumstances). Those results will provide the foundation for a better understanding of how our gut microbiomes adapt and heal when confronted with varying usages of antibiotics.
