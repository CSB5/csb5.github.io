title: Metagenomic surveillance of hawker centres in Singapore
description: We conducted city-wide metagenomic surveillance of food-centre microbiomes in Singapore (16 centres, n=240 samples) to provide a detailed map of microbial (bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses) as well as non-microbial DNA abundances.

Excited to share our work on city-wide metagenomic surveillance of hawker centres in Singapore!
 

Several surprising findings here.

Firstly, in addition to finding microbial DNA, we found plenty of non-microbial DNA, most of which looked like it had a food origin. We used this to identify food-microbe associations.

Secondly, we noticed that each hawker centre seems to have a unique microbial fingerprint, which in some cases can be largely preserved over many years

Finally, we found that hawker centres may be surprisingly enriched for antibiotic resistance genes and clinically-relevant pathogens, in some cases more than even hospital environments!
