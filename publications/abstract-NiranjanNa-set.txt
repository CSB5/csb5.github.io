As DNA data storage gains popularity, efficient trace reconstruction algorithms 
are crucial for fast decoding of data from noisy sequenced reads (or "traces"). 
Existing approaches, often adaptations of multiple sequence alignment or read 
correction methods, rely on strict assumptions of fixed error rates, showing 
limited generalizability to more complex datasets and with slower running times. 
We introduce a probabilistic formulation of the trace reconstruction problem by 
modeling traces as observations from a k-th order Markov chain. Instead of doing 
alignment, we identify the sequence most likely generated by the Markov chain as 
the consensus. This inspires bidirectional beam search (BBS), an algorithm that 
reconstructs the consensus in linear time with respect to its length. 
Experiments on multiple public Nanopore sequencing datasets demonstrate that BBS 
achieves top-tier accuracy while being approximately 20× faster than existing 
methods, showing its potential to enhance the efficiency and reliability of DNA 
data storage systems.

Background/Objectives: The presence of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in 
healthy individuals poses a significant public health concern, as these strains 
may contribute to or even facilitate the dissemination of antibiotic resistance 
genes (ARGs) and virulence factors. In this study, we investigated the genomic 
features of antimicrobial-producing Escherichia coli strains from the gut 
microbiota of healthy individuals in Singapore. Methods: Using a large-scale 
screening approach, we analyzed 3107 E. coli isolates from 109 fecal samples for 
inhibitory activity against E. coli DH5α and performed whole-genome sequencing 
on 37 representative isolates. Results: Our findings reveal genetically diverse 
strains, with isolates belonging to five phylogroups (A, B1, B2, D, and F) and 
23 unique sequence types (STs). Bacteriocin gene clusters were widespread (92% 
of isolates carried one or more bacteriocin gene clusters), with colicins and 
microcins dominating the profiles. Notably, we identified an hcp-et3-4 gene 
cluster encoding an effector linked to a Type VI secretion system. Approximately 
40% of the sequenced isolates were MDR, with resistance for up to eight 
antibiotic classes in one strain (strain D96). Plasmids were the primary 
vehicles for ARG dissemination, but chromosomal resistance determinants were 
also detected. Additionally, over 55% of isolates were classified as potential 
extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), raising concerns about their 
potential pathogenicity outside the intestinal tract. Conclusions: Our study 
highlights the co-occurrence of bacteriocin genes, ARGs, and virulence genes in 
gut-residing E. coli, underscoring their potential role in shaping microbial 
dynamics and antibiotic resistance. While bacteriocin-producing strains show 
potential as probiotic alternatives, careful assessment of their safety and 
genetic stability is necessary for therapeutic applications.

Blastocystis spp. is an enteric protist that is present worldwide. Despite being 
discovered a century ago, there is still much to be learned about its 
pathogenicity and transmission. Different subtypes (ST) of Blastocystis spp. 
have been identified in various hosts, including humans, birds, and insects, and 
there is potential for zoonotic transmission through contact between humans and 
animals. The prevalence of Blastocystis spp. in humans and macaques in Singapore 
was understudied, and the findings revealed a significant prevalence of the 
parasite, with rates of 90% and 100% observed in each respective Macaca 
fascicularis population 1 and 2, with main subtypes (ST1, ST2, ST3, and ST5). 
Using metagenomics, the different subtypes of Blastocystis spp. (comprising ST2, 
ST3, and ST17) were identified in a healthy Singaporean cohort. Additionally, 
seven incidental findings of Blastocystis spp. were discovered in human patients 
with other gut parasites, including two ST1, two ST2, two ST3, and one ST8. 
Several factors such as diet or reverse zoonotic transmission are suggested to 
play a role in Blastocystis sp. subtype distribution.

Metatranscriptomics methods for the skin are hampered by low microbial biomass, 
contamination with host cells and low RNA stability. In this study, we developed 
a robust, clinically tractable skin metatranscriptomics workflow that provides 
high technical reproducibility of profiles, uniform coverage across gene bodies 
and strong enrichment of microbial mRNAs. Paired application of this protocol 
with metagenomics to five skin sites in a cohort of 27 healthy adults identifies 
a notable divergence between transcriptomic and genomic abundances. 
Specifically, Staphylococcus species and the fungi Malassezia had an outsized 
contribution to metatranscriptomes at most sites, despite their modest 
representation in metagenomes. Species-level analysis shows signatures of 
microbial adaptation to their niches. Gene-level analysis identifies diverse 
antimicrobial genes transcribed by skin commensals in situ, including several 
uncharacterized bacteriocins. Correlation of microbial gene expression with 
organismal abundances uncovers more than 20 genes that putatively mediate 
interactions between microbes. This work highlights how skin metatranscriptomics 
identifies active species and microbial functions in situ.

The study of cancer-associated microbiomes has gained significant attention in 
recent years, spurred by advances in high-throughput sequencing and metagenomic 
analysis. Microbiome research holds promise for identifying noninvasive 
biomarkers and possibly new paradigms for cancer treatment. In this review, we 
explore the key computational challenges and opportunities in analyzing 
cancer-associated microbiomes (in tumor/normal tissues and other body sites, 
e.g., gut, oral, and skin), focusing on sequencing-driven strategies and 
associated considerations for taxonomic and functional characterization. The 
discussion covers the strengths and limitations of current analysis tools for 
identifying contamination, determining compositional bias, and resolving species 
and strains, as well as the statistical, metabolic, and network inferences that 
are essential to uncover host-microbiome interactions. Several key 
considerations are required to guide the choice of databases used for 
metagenomic analysis in such studies. Recent advances in spatial and single-cell 
technologies have provided insights into cancer-associated microbiomes, and 
Artificial Intelligence-driven protein function prediction might enable rapid 
advances in this field. Finally, we provide a perspective on how the field can 
evolve to manage the ever-growing size of datasets and generate robust and 
testable hypotheses. This article is part of a special series: Driving Cancer 
Discoveries with Computational Research, Data Science, and Machine Learning/AI .

The discovery of non-canonical bases (NCBs) and development of synthetic 
xeno-nucleic acids (XNAs) has spawned interest in many applications in viral 
genomics, synthetic biology and DNA storage. However, inability to do 
high-throughput sequencing of NCBs has been a significant limitation. We 
demonstrate that XNAs with NCBs can be robustly sequenced on a MinION system 
( > 2.3×106 reads/flowcell) to obtain significantly distinct signals from 
controls (median fold-change >6×). To enable AI-model training, we synthesized 
and sequenced a complex pool of 1,024 NCB-containing oligonucleotides with 
varied 6-mer contexts and high purity ( > 90%). Bootstrapped models assisted in 
data preparation, and data augmentation with spliced reads provided high context 
diversity, enabling learning of generalizable models to decipher NCB-containing 
sequences with high accuracy ( > 80%) and specificity (99%). These results 
highlight the versatility of nanopore sequencing for interrogating unusual 
nucleic acids, and the potential to transform the study of genetic material 
beyond those that use canonical bases.

The distribution of microorganisms in built environments with high human 
traffic, such as food centres, can potentially have a significant impact on 
public health, particularly in the context of increasing worldwide incidence of 
food and fomite-related outbreaks. In many major Asian cities, public food 
centres are central to daily food consumption, yet there is a lack of baseline 
knowledge about their environmental microbiomes. We performed a city-wide 
metagenomic survey of food-centre microbiomes in Singapore, covering 16 centres 
and 240 samples, to map the abundances of microbial (bacteria, archaea, fungi, 
viruses) and non-microbial DNA across two timepoints. Food-centre microbiomes 
were found to be enriched in food-related DNA signatures compared to other 
environments, such as hospitals and offices, with specific food-microbe 
associations (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae and fish) and food DNA providing a 
partial explanation for the microbial profiles observed (44% of variation 
explained). Machine learning analysis identified a small set of microbial 
species (n = 22) that serve as highly accurate (>80%) location-specific 
signatures for various food centres, some of which persist even after 3 years. 
Profiling of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and pathogens identified a 
surprising enrichment of ARGs in food centres relative to other non-healthcare 
environments (>2.5×), and an order of magnitude enrichment of key pathogenic 
species (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp) even compared to 
hospital environments. These results highlight the contribution of diverse 
biotic and abiotic factors in shaping the unique microbiome profiles of 
different food-centre environments, and the potential for using metagenomic 
surveillance to understand the risk for infections and antibiotic resistance 
gene transmission.

Numerous important environments harbour low levels of microbial biomass, 
including certain human tissues, the atmosphere, plant seeds, treated drinking 
water, hyper-arid soils and the deep subsurface, with some environments lacking 
resident microbes altogether. These low microbial biomass environments pose 
unique challenges for standard DNA-based sequencing approaches, as the 
inevitability of contamination from external sources becomes a critical concern 
when working near the limits of detection. Likewise, lower-biomass samples can 
be disproportionately impacted by cross-contamination and practices suitable for 
handling higher-biomass samples may produce misleading results when applied to 
lower microbial biomass samples. This Consensus Statement outlines strategies to 
reduce contamination and cross-contamination, focusing on marker gene and 
metagenomic analyses. We also provide minimal standards for reporting 
contamination information and removal workflows. Considerations must be made at 
every study stage, from sample collection and handling through data analysis and 
reporting to reduce and identify contaminants. We urge researchers to adopt 
these recommendations when designing, implementing and reporting microbiome 
studies, especially those conducted in low-biomass systems.

Application of machine learning (ML) on cancer-specific pharmacogenomic datasets 
shows immense promise for identifying predictive response biomarkers to enable 
personalized treatment. We introduce CAN-Scan, a precision oncology platform, 
which applies ML on next-generation pharmacogenomic datasets generated from a 
freeze-viable biobank of patient-derived primary cell lines (PDCs). These PDCs 
are screened against 84 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs at 
clinically relevant doses (Cmax), focusing on colorectal cancer (CRC) as a model 
system. CAN-Scan uncovers prognostic biomarkers and alternative treatment 
strategies, particularly for patients unresponsive to first-line chemotherapy. 
Specifically, it identifies gene expression signatures linked to resistance 
against 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based drugs and a focal copy-number gain on 
chromosome 7q, harboring critical resistance-associated genes. CAN-Scan-derived 
response signatures accurately predict clinical outcomes across four 
independent, ethnically diverse CRC cohorts. Notably, drug-specific ML models 
reveal regorafenib and vemurafenib as alternative treatments for 
BRAF-expressing, 5-FU-insensitive CRC. Altogether, this approach demonstrates 
significant potential in improving biomarker discovery and guiding personalized 
treatments.

Sebaceous free fatty acids are metabolized by multiple skin microbes into 
bioactive lipid mediators termed oxylipins. This study investigated correlations 
between skin oxylipins and microbes on the superficial skin of pre-pubescent 
children (N = 36) and adults (N = 100), including pre- (N = 25) and 
post-menopausal females (N = 25). Lipidomics and metagenomics revealed that 
Malassezia restricta positively correlated with the oxylipin 9,10-DiHOME on 
adult skin and negatively correlated with its precursor, 9,10-EpOME, on 
pre-pubescent skin. Co-culturing Malassezia with keratinocytes demonstrated a 
link between 9,10-DiHOME and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 
production. We also observed strong correlations between other skin oxylipins 
and microbial taxa, highlighting life stage differences in sebum production and 
microbial community composition. Our findings imply a complex host-microbe 
communication system mediated by lipid metabolism occurring on human skin, 
warranting further research into its role in skin health and disease and paving 
the way towards novel therapeutic targets and treatments.

While rapid demographic changes in Asia are driving the incidence of chronic 
aging-related diseases, the limited availability of high-quality in vivo data 
hampers our ability to understand complex multi-factorial contributions, 
including gut microbial, to healthy aging. Leveraging a well-phenotyped cohort 
of community-living octogenarians in Singapore, we used deep shotgun-metagenomic 
sequencing for high-resolution taxonomic and functional characterization of 
their gut microbiomes (n = 234). Joint species-level analysis with other Asian 
cohorts identified distinct age-associated shifts characterized by reduction in 
microbial richness, and specific Alistipes and Bacteroides species enrichment 
(e.g., Alistipes shahii and Bacteroides xylanisolvens). Functional analysis 
confirmed these changes correspond to metabolic potential expansion in aging 
towards alternate pathways synthesizing and utilizing amino-acid precursors, 
vis-à-vis dominant microbial guilds producing butyrate in gut from pyruvate 
(e.g., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia inulinivorans). Extending these 
observations to key clinical markers helped identify >10 robust microbial 
associations to inflammation, cardiometabolic and liver health, including 
potential probiotic species (e.g., Parabacteroides goldsteinii) and pathobionts 
(e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae), highlighting the microbiome's role as biomarkers 
and potential targets for promoting healthy aging.

BACKGROUND: The emerging fungal pathogen Candida auris poses a serious threat to 
global public health due to its worldwide distribution, multidrug resistance, 
high transmissibility, propensity to cause outbreaks, and high mortality. We 
aimed to characterise three unusual C auris isolates detected in Singapore, and 
to determine whether they constitute a novel clade distinct from all previously 
known C auris clades (I-V).
METHODS: In this genotypic and phenotypic study, we characterised three C auris 
clinical isolates, which were cultured from epidemiologically unlinked 
inpatients at a large tertiary hospital in Singapore. The index isolate was 
detected in April, 2023. We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and obtained 
hybrid assemblies of these C auris isolates. The complete genomes were compared 
with representative genomes of all known C auris clades. To provide a global 
context, 3651 international WGS data from the National Center for Biotechnology 
Information (NCBI) database were included in a high-resolution single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) analysis. Antifungal susceptibility testing was done and 
antifungal resistance genes, mating-type locus, and chromosomal rearrangements 
were characterised from the WGS data of the three investigated isolates. We 
further implemented Bayesian logistic regression models to classify isolates 
into known clades and simulate the automatic detection of isolates belonging to 
novel clades as their WGS data became available.
FINDINGS: The three investigated isolates were separated by at least 37 000 SNPs 
(range 37 000-236 900) from all existing C auris clades. These isolates had 
opposite mating-type allele and different chromosomal rearrangements when 
compared with their closest clade IV relatives. The isolates were susceptible to 
all tested antifungals. Therefore, we propose that these isolates represent a 
new clade of C auris, clade VI. Furthermore, an independent WGS dataset from 
Bangladesh, accessed via the NCBI Sequence Read Archive, was found to belong to 
this new clade. As a proof-of-concept, our Bayesian logistic regression model 
was able to flag these outlier genomes as a potential new clade.
INTERPRETATION: The discovery of a new C auris clade in Singapore and Bangladesh 
in the Indomalayan zone, showing a close relationship to clade IV members most 
commonly found in South America, highlights the unknown genetic diversity and 
origin of C auris, particularly in under-resourced regions. Active surveillance 
in clinical settings, along with effective sequencing strategies and downstream 
analysis, will be essential in the identification of novel strains, tracking of 
transmission, and containment of adverse clinical effects of C auris infections.

SUMMARY: Shotgun metagenomics allows for direct analysis of microbial community 
genetics, but scalable computational methods for the recovery of bacterial 
strain genomes from microbiomes remains a key challenge. We introduce Floria, a 
novel method designed for rapid and accurate recovery of strain haplotypes from 
short and long-read metagenome sequencing data, based on minimum error 
correction (MEC) read clustering and a strain-preserving network flow model. 
Floria can function as a standalone haplotyping method, outputting alleles and 
reads that co-occur on the same strain, as well as an end-to-end 
read-to-assembly pipeline (Floria-PL) for strain-level assembly. Benchmarking 
evaluations on synthetic metagenomes show that Floria is  > 3× faster and 
recovers 21% more strain content than base-level assembly methods (Strainberry) 
while being over an order of magnitude faster when only phasing is required. 
Applying Floria to a set of 109 deeply sequenced nanopore metagenomes took 
<20 min on average per sample and identified several species that have 
consistent strain heterogeneity. Applying Floria's short-read haplotyping to a 
longitudinal gut metagenomics dataset revealed a dynamic multi-strain 
Anaerostipes hadrus community with frequent strain loss and emergence events 
over 636 days. With Floria, accurate haplotyping of metagenomic datasets takes 
mere minutes on standard workstations, paving the way for extensive strain-level 
metagenomic analyses.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Floria is available at 
https://github.com/bluenote-1577/floria, and the Floria-PL pipeline is available 
at https://github.com/jsgounot/Floria_analysis_workflow along with code for 
reproducing the benchmarks.

BACKGROUND: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a fatal cancer of the bile duct with a 
poor prognosis owing to limited therapeutic options. The incidence of 
intrahepatic CCA (iCCA) is increasing worldwide, and its molecular basis is 
emerging. Environmental factors may contribute to regional differences in the 
mutation spectrum of European patients with iCCA, which are underrepresented in 
systematic genomic and transcriptomic studies of the disease.
METHODS: We describe an integrated whole-exome sequencing and transcriptomic 
study of 37 iCCAs patients in Germany.
RESULTS: We observed as most frequently mutated genes ARID1A (14%), IDH1, BAP1, 
TP53, KRAS, and ATM in 8% of patients. We identified FGFR2::BICC1 fusions in two 
tumours, and FGFR2::KCTD1 and TMEM106B::ROS1 as novel fusions with potential 
therapeutic implications in iCCA and confirmed oncogenic properties of 
TMEM106B::ROS1 in vitro. Using a data integration framework, we identified PBX1 
as a novel central regulatory gene in iCCA. We performed extended screening by 
targeted sequencing of an additional 40 CCAs. In the joint analysis, IDH1 (13%), 
BAP1 (10%), TP53 (9%), KRAS (7%), ARID1A (7%), NF1 (5%), and ATM (5%) were the 
most frequently mutated genes, and we found PBX1 to show copy gain in 20% of the 
tumours. According to other studies, amplifications of PBX1 tend to occur in 
European iCCAs in contrast to liver fluke-associated Asian iCCAs.
CONCLUSIONS: By analyzing an additional European cohort of iCCA patients, we 
found that PBX1 protein expression was a marker of poor prognosis. Overall, our 
findings provide insight into key molecular alterations in iCCA, reveal new 
targetable fusion genes, and suggest that PBX1 is a novel modulator of this 
disease.

The SARS-CoV-2 genome occupies a unique place in infection biology - it is the 
most highly sequenced genome on earth (making up over 20% of public sequencing 
datasets) with fine scale information on sampling date and geography, and has 
been subject to unprecedented intense analysis. As a result, these phylogenetic 
data are an incredibly valuable resource for science and public health. However, 
the vast majority of the data was sequenced by tiling amplicons across the full 
genome, with amplicon schemes that changed over the pandemic as mutations in the 
viral genome interacted with primer binding sites. In combination with the 
disparate set of genome assembly workflows and lack of consistent quality 
control (QC) processes, the current genomes have many systematic errors that 
have evolved with the virus and amplicon schemes. These errors have significant 
impacts on the phylogeny, and therefore over the last few years, many thousands 
of hours of researchers time has been spent in "eyeballing" trees, looking for 
artefacts, and then patching the tree. Given the huge value of this dataset, we 
therefore set out to reprocess the complete set of public raw sequence data in a 
rigorous amplicon-aware manner, and build a cleaner phylogeny. Here we provide a 
global tree of 4,471,579 samples, built from a consistently assembled set of 
high quality consensus sequences from all available public data as of June 2024, 
viewable at https://viridian.taxonium.org. Each genome was constructed using a 
novel assembly tool called Viridian (https://github.com/iqbal-lab-org/viridian), 
developed specifically to process amplicon sequence data, eliminating 
artefactual errors and mask the genome at low quality positions. We provide 
simulation and empirical validation of the methodology, and quantify the 
improvement in the phylogeny. We hope the tree, consensus sequences and Viridian 
will be a valuable resource for researchers.

BACKGROUND: With the rapid increase in throughput of long-read sequencing 
technologies, recent studies have explored their potential for taxonomic 
classification by using alignment-based approaches to reduce the impact of 
higher sequencing error rates. While alignment-based methods are generally 
slower, k-mer-based taxonomic classifiers can overcome this limitation, 
potentially at the expense of lower sensitivity for strains and species that are 
not in the database.
RESULTS: We present MetageNN, a memory-efficient long-read taxonomic classifier 
that is robust to sequencing errors and missing genomes. MetageNN is a neural 
network model that uses short k-mer profiles of sequences to reduce the impact 
of distribution shifts on error-prone long reads. Benchmarking MetageNN against 
other machine learning approaches for taxonomic classification (GeNet) showed 
substantial improvements with long-read data (20% improvement in F1 score). By 
utilizing nanopore sequencing data, MetageNN exhibits improved sensitivity in 
situations where the reference database is incomplete. It surpasses the 
alignment-based MetaMaps and MEGAN-LR, as well as the k-mer-based Kraken2 tools, 
with improvements of 100%, 36%, and 23% respectively at the read-level analysis. 
Notably, at the community level, MetageNN consistently demonstrated higher 
sensitivities than the previously mentioned tools. Furthermore, MetageNN 
requires < 1/4th of the database storage used by Kraken2, MEGAN-LR and MMseqs2 
and is > 7× faster than MetaMaps and GeNet and > 2× faster than MEGAN-LR and 
MMseqs2.
CONCLUSION: This proof of concept work demonstrates the utility of 
machine-learning-based methods for taxonomic classification using long reads. 
MetageNN can be used on sequences not classified by conventional methods and 
offers an alternative approach for memory-efficient classifiers that can be 
optimized further.

The hypervirulent lineages of Klebsiella pneumoniae (HvKp) cause invasive 
infections such as Klebsiella-liver abscess. Invasive infection often occurs 
after initial colonization of the host gastrointestinal tract by HvKp. Over 80% 
of HvKp isolates belong to the clonal group 23 sublineage I that has acquired 
genomic islands (GIs) GIE492 and ICEKp10. Our analysis of 12 361 K. pneumoniae 
genomes revealed that GIs GIE492 and ICEKp10 are co-associated with the CG23-I 
and CG10118 HvKp lineages. GIE492 and ICEKp10 enable HvKp to make a functional 
bacteriocin microcin E492 (mccE492) and the genotoxin colibactin, respectively. 
We discovered that GIE492 and ICEKp10 play cooperative roles and enhance 
gastrointestinal colonization by HvKp. Colibactin is the primary driver of this 
effect, modifying gut microbiome diversity. Our in vitro assays demonstrate that 
colibactin and mccE492 kill or inhibit a range of Gram-negative Klebsiella 
species and Escherichia coli strains, including Gram-positive bacteria, 
sometimes cooperatively. Moreover, mccE492 and colibactin kill human anaerobic 
gut commensals that are similar to the taxa found altered by colibactin in the 
mouse intestines. Our findings suggest that GIs GIE492 and ICEKp10 enable HvKp 
to kill several commensal bacterial taxa during interspecies interactions in the 
gut. Thus, acquisition of GIE492 and ICEKp10 could enable better carriage in 
host populations and explain the dominance of the CG23-I HvKp lineage.

Recently discovered tet(X) gene variants have provided new insights into 
microbial antibiotic resistance mechanisms and their potential consequences for 
public health. This study focused on detection, analysis, and characterization 
of Tet(X4)-positive Enterobacterales from the gut microbiota of a healthy cohort 
of individuals in Singapore using cultivation-dependent and 
cultivation-independent approaches. Twelve Tet(X4)-positive Enterobacterales 
strains that were previously obtained from the cohort were fully 
genome-sequenced and comparatively analyzed. A metagenomic sequencing (MS) data 
set of the same samples was mined for contigs that harbored the tet(X4) 
resistance gene. The sequences of tet(X4)-containing contigs and plasmids 
sequences were compared. The presence of the resistance genes floR and estT 
(previously annotated as catD) was detected in the same cassette in 10 and 12 
out of the 12 tet(X4)-carrying plasmids, respectively. MS detected 
tet(X4)-containing contigs in 2 out of the 109 subjects, while 
cultivation-dependent analysis previously reported a prevalence of 10.1%. The 
tet(X4)-containing sequences assembled from MS data are relatively short (~14 to 
33 kb) but show high similarity to the respective plasmid sequences of the 
isolates. Our findings show that MS can complement efforts in the surveillance 
of antibiotic resistance genes for clinical samples, while it has a lower 
sensitivity than a cultivation-based method when the target organism has a low 
abundance. Further optimization is required if MS is to be utilized in 
antibiotic resistance surveillance.IMPORTANCEThe global rise in antibiotic 
resistance makes it necessary to develop and apply new approaches to detect and 
monitor the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in human populations. In 
this regard, of particular interest are resistances against last-resort 
antibiotics, such as tigecycline. In this study, we show that metagenomic 
sequencing can help to detect high abundance of the tigecycline resistance gene 
tet(X4) in fecal samples from a cohort of healthy human subjects. However, 
cultivation-based approaches currently remain the most reliable and 
cost-effective method for detection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

The skin microbiome is an extensive community of bacteria, fungi, mites, viruses 
and archaea colonizing the skin. Fluctuations in the composition of the skin 
microbiome have been observed in atopic dermatitis (AD) and food allergy (FA), 
particularly in early life, established disease, and associated with 
therapeutics. However, AD is a multifactorial disease characterized by skin 
barrier aberrations modulated by genetics, immunology, and environmental 
influences, thus the skin microbiome is not the sole feature of this disease. 
Future research should focus on mechanistic understanding of how early-life skin 
microbial shifts may influence AD and FA onset, to guide potential early 
intervention strategies or as microbial biomarkers to identify high-risk infants 
who may benefit from possible microbiome-based biotherapeutic strategies. 
Harnessing skin microbes as AD biotherapeutics is an emerging field, but more 
work is needed to investigate whether this approach can lead to sustained 
clinical responses.

The gut microbiota is inextricably linked to human health and disease. It can 
confer colonization resistance against invading pathogens either through niche 
occupation and nutrient competition or via its secreted metabolites. Short-chain 
fatty acids (SCFA) are the primary metabolites in the gut as a result of dietary 
fiber fermentation by the gut microbiota. In this work, we demonstrate that the 
interaction of single-species gut commensals on solid media is insufficient for 
pathogen inhibition, but supernatants from monocultures of these commensal 
bacteria enriched in acetate confer inhibition against anaerobic growth of the 
enteric pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae. The three primary SCFAs (acetate, 
propionate, and butyrate) strongly inhibit the intestinal commensal Escherichia 
coli Nissle as well as a panel of enteric pathogens besides K. pneumoniae at 
physiological pH of the cecum and ascending colon. This inhibition was 
significantly milder on anaerobic gut commensals Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 
and Bifidobacterium adolescentis previously demonstrated to be associated with 
microbiota recovery after antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. We describe a general 
suppression of bacterial membrane potential by these SCFAs at physiological 
cecum and ascending colonic pH. Furthermore, the strength of bacterial 
inhibition increases with increasing alkyl chain length. Overall, the insights 
gained in this study shed light on the potential therapeutic use of SCFAs for 
conferring colonization resistance against invading pathogens in a dysbiotic 
gut.IMPORTANCERising antimicrobial resistance has made treatment of bacterial 
infections increasingly difficult. According to the World Health Organization, 
it has become a burgeoning threat to hospital and public health systems 
worldwide. This threat is largely attributed to the global rise of 
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in recent years, with common 
hospital-acquired pathogens growing increasingly resistant to last-line 
antibiotics. Antibiotics disrupt the homeostatic balance of the gut microbiota, 
resulting in the loss of colonization resistance against enteric pathogens. This 
work describes the ability of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut 
microbiota to be effective against a wide panel of enteric pathogens without 
major impact on common gut commensal species. We also demonstrate a previously 
undescribed link between alkyl chain length and antibacterial effects of SCFAs. 
SCFAs, thus, hold promise as an alternative therapeutic option leveraging on the 
antimicrobial activity of these endogenously produced gut metabolites without 
disrupting gut microbiota homeostasis.

BACKGROUND: Long reads have gained popularity in the analysis of metagenomics 
data. Therefore, we comprehensively assessed metagenomics classification tools 
on the species taxonomic level. We analysed kmer-based tools, mapping-based 
tools and two general-purpose long reads mappers. We evaluated more than 20 
pipelines which use either nucleotide or protein databases and selected 13 for 
an extensive benchmark. We prepared seven synthetic datasets to test various 
scenarios, including the presence of a host, unknown species and related 
species. Moreover, we used available sequencing data from three well-defined 
mock communities, including a dataset with abundance varying from 0.0001 to 20% 
and six real gut microbiomes.
RESULTS: General-purpose mappers Minimap2 and Ram achieved similar or better 
accuracy on most testing metrics than best-performing classification tools. They 
were up to ten times slower than the fastest kmer-based tools requiring up to 
four times less RAM. All tested tools were prone to report organisms not present 
in datasets, except CLARK-S, and they underperformed in the case of the high 
presence of the host's genetic material. Tools which use a protein database 
performed worse than those based on a nucleotide database. Longer read lengths 
made classification easier, but due to the difference in read length 
distributions among species, the usage of only the longest reads reduced the 
accuracy. The comparison of real gut microbiome datasets shows a similar 
abundance profiles for the same type of tools but discordance in the number of 
reported organisms and abundances between types. Most assessments showed the 
influence of database completeness on the reports.
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that kmer-based tools are well-suited for 
rapid analysis of long reads data. However, when heightened accuracy is 
essential, mappers demonstrate slightly superior performance, albeit at a 
considerably slower pace. Nevertheless, a combination of diverse categories of 
tools and databases will likely be necessary to analyse complex samples. 
Discrepancies observed among tools when applied to real gut datasets, as well as 
a reduced performance in cases where unknown species or a significant proportion 
of the host genome is present in the sample, highlight the need for continuous 
improvement of existing tools. Additionally, regular updates and curation of 
databases are important to ensure their effectiveness.

Human blood is conventionally considered sterile but recent studies suggest the 
presence of a blood microbiome in healthy individuals. Here we characterized the 
DNA signatures of microbes in the blood of 9,770 healthy individuals using 
sequencing data from multiple cohorts. After filtering for contaminants, we 
identified 117 microbial species in blood, some of which had DNA signatures of 
microbial replication. They were primarily commensals associated with the gut 
(n = 40), mouth (n = 32) and genitourinary tract (n = 18), and were distinct 
from pathogens detected in hospital blood cultures. No species were detected in 
84% of individuals, while the remainder only had a median of one species. Less 
than 5% of individuals shared the same species, no co-occurrence patterns 
between different species were observed and no associations between host 
phenotypes and microbes were found. Overall, these results do not support the 
hypothesis of a consistent core microbiome endogenous to human blood. Rather, 
our findings support the transient and sporadic translocation of commensal 
microbes from other body sites into the bloodstream.

Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) is a rare and benign inflammatory breast 
disease with ambiguous aetiology. Contrastingly, lactational mastitis (LM) is 
commonly diagnosed in breastfeeding women. To investigate IGM aetiology, we 
profiled the microbial flora of pus and skin in patients with IGM and LM. A 
total of 26 patients with IGM and 6 patients with LM were included in the study. 
The 16S rRNA sequencing libraries were constructed from 16S rRNA gene amplified 
from total DNA extracted from pus and skin swabs in patients with IGM and LM 
controls. Constructed libraries were multiplexed and paired-end sequenced on 
HiSeq4000. Metagenomic analysis was conducted using modified microbiome 
abundance analysis suite customised R-resource for paired pus and skin samples. 
Microbiome multivariable association analyses were performed using linear 
models. A total of 21 IGM and 3 LM paired pus and skin samples underwent 
metagenomic analysis. Bray−Curtis ecological dissimilarity distance showed 
dissimilarity across four sample types (IGM pus, IGM skin, LM pus, and LM skin; 
PERMANOVA, p < 0.001). No characteristic dominant genus was observed across the 
IGM samples. The IGM pus samples were more diverse than corresponding IGM skin 
samples (Shannon and Simpson index; Wilcoxon paired signed-rank tests, p = 0.022 
and p = 0.07). Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii, reportedly associated with IGM in 
the literature, was higher in IGM pus samples than paired skin samples 
(Wilcoxon, p = 0.022). Three other species and nineteen genera were 
statistically significant in paired IGM pus−skin comparison after antibiotic 
treatment adjustment and multiple comparisons correction. Microbial profiles are 
unique between patients with IGM and LM. Inter-patient variability and 
polymicrobial IGM pus samples cannot implicate specific genus or species as an 
infectious cause for IGM.

Extensive in vitro cancer drug screening datasets have enabled scientists to 
identify biomarkers and develop machine learning models for predicting drug 
sensitivity. While most advancements have focused on omics profiles, cancer drug 
sensitivity scores precalculated by the original sources are often used as-is, 
without consideration for variabilities between studies. It is well-known that 
significant inconsistencies exist between the drug sensitivity scores across 
datasets due to differences in experimental setups and preprocessing methods 
used to obtain the sensitivity scores. As a result, many studies opt to focus 
only on a single dataset, leading to underutilization of available data and a 
limited interpretation of cancer pharmacogenomics analysis. To overcome these 
caveats, we have developed CREAMMIST (https://creammist.mtms.dev), an 
integrative database that enables users to obtain an integrative dose-response 
curve, to capture uncertainty (or high certainty when multiple datasets well 
align) across five widely used cancer cell-line drug-response datasets. We 
utilized the Bayesian framework to systematically integrate all available 
dose-response values across datasets (>14 millions dose-response data points). 
CREAMMIST provides easy-to-use statistics derived from the integrative 
dose-response curves for various downstream analyses such as identifying 
biomarkers, selecting drug concentrations for experiments, and training robust 
machine learning models.

Despite extensive efforts to address it, the vastness of uncharacterized 'dark 
matter' microbial genetic diversity can impact short-read sequencing based 
metagenomic studies. Population-specific biases in genomic reference databases 
can further compound this problem. Leveraging advances in hybrid assembly (using 
short and long reads) and Hi-C technologies in a cross-sectional survey, we 
deeply characterized 109 gut microbiomes from three ethnicities in Singapore to 
comprehensively reconstruct 4497 medium and high-quality metagenome assembled 
genomes, 1708 of which were missing in short-read only analysis and with >28× 
N50 improvement. Species-level clustering identified 70 (>10% of total) novel 
gut species out of 685, improved reference genomes for 363 species (53% of 
total), and discovered 3413 strains unique to these populations. Among the top 
10 most abundant gut bacteria in our study, one of the species and >80% of 
strains were unrepresented in existing databases. Annotation of biosynthetic 
gene clusters (BGCs) uncovered more than 27,000 BGCs with a large fraction 
(36-88%) unrepresented in current databases, and with several unique clusters 
predicted to produce bacteriocins that could significantly alter microbiome 
community structure. These results reveal significant uncharacterized gut 
microbial diversity in Southeast Asian populations and highlight the utility of 
hybrid metagenomic references for bioprospecting and disease-focused studies.

Singapore's National Flower, Papilionanthe (Ple.) Miss Joaquim 'Agnes' (PMJ) is 
highly prized as a horticultural flower from the Orchidaceae family. A 
combination of short-read sequencing, single-molecule long-read sequencing and 
chromatin contact mapping was used to assemble the PMJ genome, spanning 2.5 Gb 
and 19 pseudo-chromosomal scaffolds. Genomic resources and chemical profiling 
provided insights towards identifying, understanding and elucidating various 
classes of secondary metabolite compounds synthesized by the flower. For 
example, presence of the anthocyanin pigments detected by chemical profiling 
coincides with the expression of ANTHOCYANIN SYNTHASE (ANS), an enzyme 
responsible for the synthesis of the former. Similarly, the presence of 
vandaterosides (a unique class of glycosylated organic acids with the potential 
to slow skin aging) discovered using chemical profiling revealed the involvement 
of glycosyltransferase family enzymes candidates in vandateroside biosynthesis. 
Interestingly, despite the unnoticeable scent of the flower, genes involved in 
the biosynthesis of volatile compounds and chemical profiling revealed the 
combination of oxygenated hydrocarbons, including traces of linalool, 
beta-ionone and vanillin, forming the scent profile of PMJ. In summary, by 
combining genomics and biochemistry, the findings expands the known biodiversity 
repertoire of the Orchidaceae family and insights into the genome and secondary 
metabolite processes of PMJ.

Long-term colonization of the gut microbiome by carbapenemase-producing 
Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) is a growing area of public health concern as it can 
lead to community transmission and rapid increase in cases of life-threatening 
CPE infections. Here, leveraging the observation that many subjects are 
decolonized without interventions within a year, we used longitudinal shotgun 
metagenomics (up to 12 timepoints) for detailed characterization of ecological 
and evolutionary dynamics in the gut microbiome of a cohort of CPE-colonized 
subjects and family members (n = 46; 361 samples). Subjects who underwent 
decolonization exhibited a distinct ecological shift marked by recovery of 
microbial diversity, key commensals and anti-inflammatory pathways. In addition, 
colonization was marked by elevated but unstable Enterobacteriaceae abundances, 
which exhibited distinct strain-level dynamics for different species 
(Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae). Finally, comparative analysis with 
whole-genome sequencing data from CPE isolates (n = 159) helped identify 
substrain variation in key functional genes and the presence of highly similar 
E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains with variable resistance profiles and plasmid 
sharing. These results provide an enhanced view into how colonization by 
multi-drug-resistant bacteria associates with altered gut ecology and can enable 
transfer of resistance genes, even in the absence of overt infection and 
antibiotic usage.

BACKGROUND: The transient and fragmented nature of the deep-sea hydrothermal 
environment made of ridge subduction, plate collision and the emergence of new 
rifts is currently acting to separate of vent populations, promoting local 
adaptation and contributing to bursts of speciation and species specialization. 
The tube-dwelling worms Alvinella pompejana called the Pompeii worm and its 
sister species A. caudata live syntopically on the hottest part of deep-sea 
hydrothermal chimneys along the East Pacific Rise. They are exposed to extreme 
thermal and chemical gradients, which vary greatly in space and time, and thus 
represent ideal candidates for understanding the evolutionary mechanisms at play 
in the vent fauna evolution.
RESULTS: We explored genomic patterns of divergence in the early and late stages 
of speciation of these emblematic worms using transcriptome assemblies and the 
first draft genome to better understand the relative role of geographic 
isolation and habitat preference in their genome evolution. Analyses were 
conducted on allopatric populations of Alvinella pompejana (early stage of 
separation) and between A. pompejana and its syntopic species Alvinella caudata 
(late stage of speciation). We first identified divergent genomic regions and 
targets of selection as well as their position in the genome over collections of 
orthologous genes and, then, described the speciation dynamics by documenting 
the annotation of the most divergent and/or positively selected genes involved 
in the isolation process. Gene mapping clearly indicated that divergent genes 
associated with the early stage of speciation, although accounting for nearly 
30% of genes, are highly scattered in the genome without any island of 
divergence and not involved in gamete recognition or mito-nuclear 
incompatibilities. By contrast, genomes of A. pompejana and A. caudata are 
clearly separated with nearly all genes (96%) exhibiting high divergence. This 
congealing effect however seems to be linked to habitat specialization and still 
allows positive selection on genes involved in gamete recognition, as a possible 
long-duration process of species reinforcement.
CONCLUSION: Our analyses highlight the non-negligible role of natural selection 
on both the early and late stages of speciation in the iconic thermophilic worms 
living on the walls of deep-sea hydrothermal chimneys. They shed light on the 
evolution of gene divergence during the process of speciation and species 
specialization over a very long period of time.

Shigella flexneri is a major diarrhoeal pathogen, and the emergence of 
multidrug-resistant S. flexneri is of public health concern. We report the 
detection of a clonal cluster of multidrug-resistant serotype 1c (7a) S. 
flexneri in Singapore in April 2022. Long-read whole-genome sequence analysis 
found five S. flexneri isolates to be clonal and harboring the extended-spectrum 
β-lactamases bla CTX-M-15 and bla TEM-1. The isolates were phenotypically 
resistant to ceftriaxone and had intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. 
The S. flexneri clonal cluster was first detected in a tertiary hospital 
diagnostic laboratory (sentinel-site), to which the S. flexneri isolates were 
sent from other hospitals for routine serogrouping. Long-read whole-genome 
sequence analysis was performed in the sentinel-site near real-time in view of 
the unusually high number of S. flexneri isolates received within a short time 
frame. This study demonstrates that near real-time sentinel-site sequence-based 
surveillance of convenience samples can detect possible clonal outbreak clusters 
and may provide alerts useful for public health mitigations at the earliest 
possible opportunity.

Dissemination of carbapenemase-encoding plasmids by horizontal gene transfer in 
multidrug-resistant bacteria is the major driver of rising 
carbapenem-resistance, but the conjugative mechanics and evolution of clinically 
relevant plasmids are not yet clear. We performed whole-genome sequencing on 
1,215 clinical Enterobacterales isolates collected in Singapore during 
2010-2015. We identified 1,126 carbapenemase-encoding plasmids and discovered 
pKPC2 is becoming the dominant plasmid in Singapore, overtaking an earlier 
dominant plasmid, pNDM1. pKPC2 frequently conjugates with many Enterobacterales 
species, including hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae, and maintains stability 
in vitro without selection pressure and minimal adaptive sequence changes. 
Furthermore, capsule and decreasing taxonomic relatedness between donor and 
recipient pairs are greater conjugation barriers for pNDM1 than pKPC2. The low 
fitness costs pKPC2 exerts in Enterobacterales species indicate previously 
undetected carriage selection in other ecological settings. The ease of 
conjugation and stability of pKPC2 in hypervirulent K. pneumoniae could fuel 
spread into the community.

Methanogenic Archaea (methanogens) are a phylogenetically diverse group of 
microorganisms and are considered to be the most abundant archaeal 
representatives in the human gut. However, the gut methanogen diversity of human 
populations in many global regions remains poorly investigated. Here, we report 
the abundance and diversity of gut methanogenic Archaea in a multi-ethnic cohort 
of healthy Singaporeans by using a concerted approach of metagenomic sequencing, 
16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and quantitative PCR. Our results indicate a 
mutual exclusion of Methanobrevibacter species, i.e., the highly prevalent 
Methanobrevibacter smithii and the less prevalent Candidatus Methanobrevibacter 
intestini in more than 80% of the samples when using an amplicon 
sequencing-based approach. Leveraging on this finding, we were able to select a 
fecal sample to isolate a representative strain, TLL-48-HuF1, for Candidatus 
Methanobrevibacter intestini. The analyzed physiological parameters of M. 
smithii DSM 861T and strain TLL-48-HuF1 suggest high similarity of the two 
species. Comparative genome analysis and the mutual exclusion of the 
Methanobrevibacter species indicate potentially different niche adaptation 
strategies in the human host, which may support the designation of Candidatus M. 
intestini as a novel species. IMPORTANCE Methanogens are important hydrogen 
consumers in the gut and are associated with differing host health. Here, we 
determine the prevalence and abundance of archaeal species in the guts of a 
multi-ethnic cohort of healthy Singapore residents. While Methanobrevibacter 
smithii is the most prevalent and abundant methanogen in the human gut of local 
subjects, the recently proposed Candidatus Methanobrevibacter intestini is the 
abundant methanogen in a minority of individuals that harbor them. The observed 
potential mutual exclusion of M. smithii and Ca. M. intestini provides further 
support to the proposal that the two physiologically similar strains may belong 
to different Methanobrevibacter species.

Immunocompromised hosts with prolonged severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections have been implicated in the emergence of 
highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants. Spike mutations are of particular concern 
because the spike protein is a key target for vaccines and therapeutics for 
SARS-CoV-2. Here, we report the emergence of spike mutations in two 
immunocompromised patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription 
(RT)-PCR positivity (>90 days). Whole-genome sequence analysis of samples 
obtained before and after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment 
demonstrated the development of partial therapeutic escape mutations and 
increased intrahost SARS-CoV-2 genome diversity over time. This case series thus 
adds to the accumulating evidence that immunocompromised hosts with persistent 
infections are important sources of SARS-CoV-2 genome diversity and, in 
particular, clinically important spike protein diversity. IMPORTANCE The 
emergence of clinically important mutations described in this report highlights 
the need for sustained vigilance and containment measures when managing 
immunocompromised patients with persistent COVID-19. Even as jurisdictions 
across the globe start lifting pandemic control measures, immunocompromised 
patients with persistent COVID-19 constitute a unique group that requires close 
genomic monitoring and enhanced infection control measures, to ensure early 
detection and containment of mutations and variants of therapeutic and public 
health importance.

Hypercholesterolemia is becoming a problem with increasing significance. Dietary 
vegetable oils may help to improve this condition due to presence of 
phytonutrients with potentially synergistic cholesterol-lowering effects. The 
objective of this 8-week double-blinded randomized clinical trial was to 
investigate the effects of consuming 30 g of two different blended cooking oils, 
rich in omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid and phytonutrients, or refined olive oil on 
the intestinal microbiota in 126 volunteers with borderline 
hypercholesterolemia. Multi-factor analysis of relationships between the gut 
microbiota composition at various taxonomic ranks and the clinical trial 
parameters revealed the association between beneficial effects of the dietary 
intervention on the blood lipid profile with abundance of Clostridia class of 
the gut microbiota. This microbiota feature was upregulated in the course of the 
dietary intervention and associated with various plasma markers of metabolic 
health status, such as Triglycerides, Apolipoprotein B and Total Cholesterol to 
HDL ratio in a beneficial way. The relative abundance of a single 
species-Clostridium leptum-highly increased during the dietary intervention in 
all the three study groups. The oil blend with the highest concentration of 
omega-3 PUFA is associated with faster and more robust responses of the 
intestinal microbiota, including elevation of alpha-diversity. Butyrate 
production is being discussed as a plausible process mediating the observed 
beneficial influence on the plasma lipid profile. Causal mediation analysis 
suggested that Clostridium genus rather than the higher rank of the 
phylogeny-Clostridia class-may be involved in the diet-induced improvements of 
the blood lipid profile.

methods on realistic and complex datasets with long- and short-read sequences, 
created computationally from around 1,700 new and known genomes, as well as 600 
new plasmids and viruses. Here we analyze 5,002 results by 76 program versions. 
Substantial improvements were seen in assembly, some due to long-read data. 
Related strains still were challenging for assembly and genome recovery through 
binning, as was assembly quality for the latter. Profilers markedly matured, 
with taxon profilers and binners excelling at higher bacterial ranks, but 
underperforming for viruses and Archaea. Clinical pathogen detection results 
revealed a need to improve reproducibility. Runtime and memory usage analyses 
identified efficient programs, including top performers with other metrics. The 
results identify challenges and guide researchers in selecting methods for 
analyses.

Lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic include increased awareness of the 
potential for zoonoses and emerging infectious diseases that can adversely 
affect human health. Although emergent viruses are currently in the spotlight, 
we must not forget the ongoing toll of morbidity and mortality owing to 
antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens and to vector-borne, foodborne 
and waterborne diseases. Population growth, planetary change, international 
travel and medical tourism all contribute to the increasing frequency of 
infectious disease outbreaks. Surveillance is therefore of crucial importance, 
but the diversity of microbial pathogens, coupled with resource-intensive 
methods, compromises our ability to scale-up such efforts. Innovative 
technologies that are both easy to use and able to simultaneously identify 
diverse microorganisms (viral, bacterial or fungal) with precision are necessary 
to enable informed public health decisions. Metagenomics-enabled surveillance 
methods offer the opportunity to improve detection of both known and 
yet-to-emerge pathogens.

BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic skin condition in 
children (15-20%) that can significantly impair their quality of life. As a 
result of its relapsing nature and enrichment of Staphylococcus aureus during 
flares, clinical management can include eradicating S aureus from the skin of 
children; however, this does not extend to their healthy caregivers, who are 
potential reservoirs.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to understand skin microbiome sharing and microbial 
features in children with AD and their healthy adult caregivers.
METHODS: We utilized whole-metagenome profiling at 4 body sites (volar forearm, 
antecubital fossae, cheeks, and lesions) in combination with sequencing of S 
aureus isolates to characterize a cohort of children with AD and their healthy 
caregivers (n = 30 families) compared to matched pairs from control households 
(n = 30 families).
RESULTS: Metagenomic analysis revealed distinct microbiome configurations in the 
nonlesional skin of AD children and their healthy caregivers versus controls, 
which were sufficient to accurately predict case-control status (area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve > 0.8). These differences were 
accompanied by significant microbiome similarity between children and their 
caregivers, indicating that microbiome sharing may play a role in recurrent 
disease flares. Whole-genome comparisons with high-quality S aureus isolate 
genomes (n = 55) confirmed significant strain sharing between AD children and 
their caregivers and AD-specific enrichment of strains expressing enterotoxins Q 
and K/K2.
CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the distinctive skin microbiome features of 
healthy caregivers for children with AD and support their inclusion in 
strategies for the treatment of recurrent pediatric AD.

Rapid onsite whole-genome sequencing of two suspected severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) N gene diagnostic escape samples revealed a 
previously unreported N gene point mutation at genome position 29195. Because 
the G29195T mutation occurs within a region probed by a commonly referenced U.S. 
CDC N gene reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay, we hypothesize that the G29195T 
mutation rendered the N gene target of a proprietary commercial assay 
undetectable. The putative diagnostic escape G29195T mutation demonstrates the 
need for nearly real-time surveillance, as emergence of a novel SARS-CoV-2 
variant with the potential to escape diagnostic tests continues to be a threat. 
IMPORTANCE Accurate diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2 currently depends on the 
large-scale deployment of RT-PCR assays. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays target 
predetermined regions in the viral genomes by complementary binding of primers 
and probes to nucleic acid sequences in the clinical samples. Potential 
diagnostic escapes, such as those of clinical samples harboring the G29195T 
mutation, may result in false-negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results. The rapid 
detection and sharing of potential diagnostic escapes are essential for 
diagnostic laboratories and manufacturers around the world, to optimize their 
assays as SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve.

Background: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis caused by 
the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Establishing links between known cases is crucial for 
the containment of COVID-19. In the healthcare setting, the ability to rapidly 
identify potential healthcare-associated COVID-19 clusters is critical for 
healthcare worker and patient safety. Increasing sequencing technology 
accessibility has allowed routine clinical diagnostic laboratories to sequence 
SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. However, these laboratories often lack 
specialized informatics skills required for sequence analysis. Therefore, an 
on-site, intuitive sequence analysis tool that enables clinical laboratory users 
to analyze multiple genomes and derive clinically relevant information within an 
actionable timeframe is needed. Results: We propose CalmBelt, an integrated 
framework for on-site whole genome characterization and outbreak tracking. 
Nanopore sequencing technology enables on-site sequencing and construction of 
draft genomes for multiple SARS-CoV-2 samples within 12 h. CalmBelt's 
interactive interface allows users to analyse multiple SARS-CoV-2 genomes by 
utilizing whole genome information, collection date, and additional information 
such as predefined potential clusters from epidemiological investigations. 
CalmBelt also integrates established SARS-CoV-2 nomenclature assignments, GISAID 
clades and PANGO lineages, allowing users to visualize relatedness between 
samples together with the nomenclatures. We demonstrated multiple use cases 
including investigation of potential hospital transmission, mining transmission 
patterns in a large outbreak, and monitoring possible diagnostic-escape. 
Conclusions: This paper presents an on-site rapid framework for SARS-CoV-2 whole 
genome characterization. CalmBelt interactive web application allows 
non-technical users, such as routine clinical laboratory users in hospitals to 
determine SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, as well as investigate the presence of 
potential transmission clusters. The framework is designed to be compatible with 
routine usage in clinical laboratories as it only requires readily available 
sample data, and generates information that impacts immediate infection control 
mitigations.

While understanding molecular heterogeneity across patients underpins precision 
oncology, there is increasing appreciation for taking intra-tumor heterogeneity 
into account. Based on large-scale analysis of cancer omics datasets, we 
highlight the importance of intra-tumor transcriptomic heterogeneity (ITTH) for 
predicting clinical outcomes. Leveraging single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) with a 
recommender system (CaDRReS-Sc), we show that heterogeneous gene-expression 
signatures can predict drug response with high accuracy (80%). Using 
patient-proximal cell lines, we established the validity of CaDRReS-Sc's 
monotherapy (Pearson r>0.6) and combinatorial predictions targeting 
clone-specific vulnerabilities (>10% improvement). Applying CaDRReS-Sc to 
rapidly expanding scRNA-seq compendiums can serve as in silico screen to 
accelerate drug-repurposing studies. Availability:

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli strains that carry extended-spectrum 
β-lactamases (ESBLs) or colistin resistance gene mcr-1 have been identified in 
the human gut at an increasing incidence worldwide. In this study, we isolated 
and characterized MDR Enterobacteriaceae from the gut microbiota of healthy 
Singaporeans and show that the detection rates for ESBL-producing and 
mcr-positive Enterobacteriaceae are 25.7% (28/109) and 7.3% (8/109), 
respectively. Whole-genome sequencing analysis of the 37 E. coli isolates 
assigned them into 25 sequence types and 6 different phylogroups, suggesting 
that the MDR E. coli gut colonizers are highly diverse. We then analyzed the 
genetic context of the resistance genes and found that composite transposons 
played important roles in the cotransfer of blaCTX-M-15/55 and qnrS1, as well as 
the acquisition of mcr-1. Furthermore, comparative genomic analysis showed that 
12 of the 37 MDR E. coli isolates showed high similarity to ESBL-producing E. 
coli isolates from raw meat products in local markets. By analyzing the core 
genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) shared by these isolates, we 
identified possible clonal transmission of an MDR E. coli clone between human 
and raw meat, as well as a group of highly similar IncI2 (Delta) plasmids that 
might be responsible for the dissemination of mcr-1 in a much wider geographic 
region. Together, these results suggest that antibiotic resistance may be 
transmitted between different environmental settings by the expansion of MDR E. 
coli clones, as well as by the dissemination of resistance plasmids. IMPORTANCE 
The human gut can harbor both antibiotic-resistant and virulent Escherichia coli 
which may subsequently cause infections. In this study, we found that 
multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli isolates from the gut of healthy Singaporeans 
carry a diverse range of antibiotic resistance mechanisms and virulence factor 
genes and are highly diverse. By comparing their genomes with the 
extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolates from raw meat 
products that were sampled at a similar time from local markets, we detected an 
MDR E. coli clone that was possibly transmitted between humans and raw meat 
products. Furthermore, we also found that a group of resistance plasmids might 
be responsible for the dissemination of colistin resistance gene mcr-1 in 
Singapore, Malaysia, and Europe. Our findings call for better countermeasures to 
block the transmission of antibiotic resistance.

We present a global atlas of 4,728 metagenomic samples from mass-transit systems 
in 60 cities over 3 years, representing the first systematic, worldwide catalog 
of the urban microbial ecosystem. This atlas provides an annotated, geospatial 
profile of microbial strains, functional characteristics, antimicrobial 
resistance (AMR) markers, and genetic elements, including 10,928 viruses, 1,302 
bacteria, 2 archaea, and 838,532 CRISPR arrays not found in reference databases. 
We identified 4,246 known species of urban microorganisms and a consistent set 
of 31 species found in 97% of samples that were distinct from human commensal 
organisms. Profiles of AMR genes varied widely in type and density across 
cities. Cities showed distinct microbial taxonomic signatures that were driven 
by climate and geographic differences. These results constitute a 
high-resolution global metagenomic atlas that enables discovery of organisms and 
genes, highlights potential public health and forensic applications, and 
provides a culture-independent view of AMR burden in cities.

BACKGROUND: Whole genome sequencing of cultured pathogens is the state of the 
art public health response for the bioinformatic source tracking of illness 
outbreaks. Quasimetagenomics can substantially reduce the amount of culturing 
needed before a high quality genome can be recovered. Highly accurate short read 
data is analyzed for single nucleotide polymorphisms and multi-locus sequence 
types to differentiate strains but cannot span many genomic repeats, resulting 
in highly fragmented assemblies. Long reads can span repeats, resulting in much 
more contiguous assemblies, but have lower accuracy than short reads.
RESULTS: We evaluated the accuracy of Listeria monocytogenes assemblies from 
enrichments (quasimetagenomes) of naturally-contaminated ice cream using long 
read (Oxford Nanopore) and short read (Illumina) sequencing data. Accuracy of 
ten assembly approaches, over a range of sequencing depths, was evaluated by 
comparing sequence similarity of genes in assemblies to a complete reference 
genome. Long read assemblies reconstructed a circularized genome as well as a 71 
kbp plasmid after 24 h of enrichment; however, high error rates prevented high 
fidelity gene assembly, even at 150X depth of coverage. Short read assemblies 
accurately reconstructed the core genes after 28 h of enrichment but produced 
highly fragmented genomes. Hybrid approaches demonstrated promising results but 
had biases based upon the initial assembly strategy. Short read assemblies 
scaffolded with long reads accurately assembled the core genes after just 24 h 
of enrichment, but were highly fragmented. Long read assemblies polished with 
short reads reconstructed a circularized genome and plasmid and assembled all 
the genes after 24 h enrichment but with less fidelity for the core genes than 
the short read assemblies.
CONCLUSION: The integration of long and short read sequencing of 
quasimetagenomes expedited the reconstruction of a high quality pathogen genome 
compared to either platform alone. A new and more complete level of information 
about genome structure, gene order and mobile elements can be added to the 
public health response by incorporating long read analyses with the standard 
short read WGS outbreak response.

MOTIVATION: Large-scale cancer omics studies have highlighted the diversity of 
patient molecular profiles and the importance of leveraging this information to 
deliver the right drug to the right patient at the right time. Key challenges in 
learning predictive models for this include the high-dimensionality of omics 
data and heterogeneity in biological and clinical factors affecting patient 
response. The use of multi-task learning techniques has been widely explored to 
address dataset limitations for in vitro drug response models, while domain 
adaptation (DA) has been employed to extend them to predict in vivo response. In 
both of these transfer learning settings, noisy data for some tasks (or domains) 
can substantially reduce the performance for others compared to single-task 
(domain) learners, i.e. lead to negative transfer (NT).
RESULTS: We describe a novel multi-task unsupervised DA method (TUGDA) that 
addresses these limitations in a unified framework by quantifying uncertainty in 
predictors and weighting their influence on shared feature representations. 
TUGDA's ability to rely more on predictors with low-uncertainty allowed it to 
notably reduce cases of NT for in vitro models (94% overall) compared to 
state-of-the-art methods. For DA to in vivo settings, TUGDA improved over 
previous methods for patient-derived xenografts (9 out of 14 drugs) as well as 
patient datasets (significant associations in 9 out of 22 drugs). TUGDA's 
ability to avoid NT thus provides a key capability as we try to integrate 
diverse drug-response datasets to build consistent predictive models with in 
vivo utility.

OBJECTIVES: Hypermucoviscous Klebsiella pneumoniae is an emerging cause of 
community-acquired liver abscess. The aim of this study was to investigate 
whether hypermucoviscous strains could be shared among households.
METHODS: The clinical K. pneumoniae isolates from a cohort of 24 patients with 
Klebsiella liver abscess were genotyped, and the stool metagenomes of the index 
patients and their cohabiting domestic partners were analyzed.
RESULTS: K. pneumoniae was identified in 33% of index patient stools, and one 
index patient's clinical isolate was identified in their domestic partner's 
stool.
CONCLUSIONS: This could represent a transmission event or could represent 
exposure to a common environmental source.

Asian subjects with Crohn's disease (CD) using whole genome shotgun sequencing, 
thereby allowing for strain-level comparison.
METHODS: A case-control study with age, sex and ethnicity matched healthy 
controls was conducted. CD subjects were limited to well-controlled patients 
without oral manifestations. Fecal and saliva samples were collected for 
characterization of gut and oral microbiome respectively. Microbial DNA were 
extracted, libraries prepared and sequenced reads profiled. Taxonomic diversity, 
taxonomic association, strain typing and microbial gene pathway analyses were 
conducted.
RESULTS: The study recruited 25 subjects with CD and 25 healthy controls. The 
oral microbe Streptococcus salivarius was found to be enriched and of concordant 
strains in the gut and oral microbiome of Crohn's disease subjects. This was 
more likely in CD subjects with higher Crohn's Disease Activity Index 
(184.3 ± 2.9 vs 67.1 ± 82.5, p = 0.012) and active disease status 
(Diarrhoea/abdominal pain/blood-in-stool/fever and fatigue) (p = 0.016). Gut 
species found to be significantly depleted in CD compared to control (Relative 
abundance: Median[Range]) include: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (0.03[0.00-4.56] 
vs 13.69[5.32-18.71], p = 0.010), Roseburia inulinivorans (0.00[0.00-0.03] vs 
0.21[0.01-0.53], p = 0.010) and Alistipes senegalensis (0.00[0.00-0.00] vs 
0.00[0.00-0.02], p = 0.029). While Clostridium nexile (0.00[0.00-0.12] vs 
0.00[0.00-0.00], p = 0.038) and Ruminococcus gnavus (0.43[0.02-0.33] vs 
0.00[0.00-0.13], p = 0.043) were found to be enriched. C. nexile enrichment was 
not found in CD subjects of European descent. Microbial arginine 
(Linear-discriminant-analysis: 3.162, p = 0.001) and isoprene 
(Linear-discriminant-analysis: 3.058, p < 0.001) pathways were found at a higher 
relative abundance level in gut microbiome of Crohn's disease.
CONCLUSIONS: There was evidence of ectopic gut colonization by oral bacteria, 
especially during the active phase of CD. Previously studied gut microbial 
differences were detected, in addition to novel associations which could have 
resulted from geographical/ethnic differences to subjects of European descent. 
Differences in microbial pathways provide possible targets for microbiome 
modification.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the transmission rate of carbapenemase-producing 
Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in households with recently hospitalized CPE carriers.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective case-ascertained cohort study. We identified 
the presence of CPE in stool samples from index subjects, household contacts and 
companion animals and environmental samples at regular intervals. Linked 
transmissions were identified by WGS. A Markov model was constructed to estimate 
the household transmission potential of CPE.
RESULTS: Ten recently hospitalized index patients and 14 household contacts were 
included. There were seven households with one contact, two households with two 
contacts, and one household with three contacts. Index patients were colonized 
with blaOXA-48-like (n = 4), blaKPC-2 (n = 3), blaIMP (n = 2), and blaNDM-1 
(n = 1), distributed among divergent species of Enterobacteriaceae. After a 
cumulative follow-up time of 9.0 years, three family members (21.4%, 3/14) 
acquired four different types of CPE in the community (hazard rate of 
0.22/year). The probability of CPE transmission from an index patient to a 
household contact was 10% (95% CI 4%-26%).
CONCLUSIONS: We observed limited transmission of CPE from an index patient to 
household contacts. Larger studies are needed to understand the factors 
associated with household transmission of CPE and identify preventive 
strategies.

Growing evidence indicates a role for the gut microbiota in modulating 
anti-tumor treatment efficacy in human cancer. Here we study mucosa-associated 
invariant T (MAIT) cells to look for evidence of bacterial antigen recognition 
in human colon, lung, and kidney carcinomas. Using mass cytometry and 
single-cell mRNA sequencing, we identify a tumor-infiltrating MAIT cell subset 
expressing CD4 and Foxp3 and observe high expression of CD39 on MAIT cells from 
colorectal cancer (CRC) only, which we show in vitro to be expressed 
specifically after TCR stimulation. We further reveal that these cells are 
phenotypically and functionally exhausted. Sequencing data show high bacterial 
infiltration in CRC tumors and highlight an enriched species, Fusobacteria 
nucleatum, with capability to activate MAIT cells in a TCR-dependent way. Our 
results provide evidence of a MAIT cell response to microbial antigens in CRC 
and could pave the way for manipulating MAIT cells or the microbiome for cancer 
therapy.

Current methods for determining RNA structure with short-read sequencing cannot 
capture most differences between distinct transcript isoforms. Here we present 
RNA structure analysis using nanopore sequencing (PORE-cupine), which combines 
structure probing using chemical modifications with direct long-read RNA 
sequencing and machine learning to detect secondary structures in cellular RNAs. 
PORE-cupine also captures global structural features, such as 
RNA-binding-protein binding sites and reactivity differences at 
single-nucleotide variants. We show that shared sequences in different 
transcript isoforms of the same gene can fold into different structures, 
highlighting the importance of long-read sequencing for obtaining phase 
information. We also demonstrate that structural differences between transcript 
isoforms of the same gene lead to differences in translation efficiency. By 
revealing isoform-specific RNA structure, PORE-cupine will deepen understanding 
of the role of structures in controlling gene regulation.

BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common skin disease affecting up to 20% 
of the global population, with significant clinical heterogeneity and limited 
information about molecular subtypes and actionable biomarkers. Although 
alterations in the skin microbiome have been described in subjects with AD 
during progression to flare state, the prognostic value of baseline microbiome 
configurations has not been explored.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to identify microbial signatures on AD skin that are 
predictive of disease fate.
METHODS: Nonlesional skin of patients with AD and healthy control subjects were 
sampled at 2 time points separated by at least 4 weeks. Using whole metagenome 
analysis of skin microbiomes of patients with AD and control subjects (n = 49 
and 189 samples), we identified distinct microbiome configurations (dermotypes 
A and B). Blood was collected for immunophenotyping, and skin surface samples 
were analyzed for correlations with natural moisturizing factors and 
antimicrobial peptides.
RESULTS: Dermotypes were robust and validated across 2 additional cohorts (63 
individuals), with strong enrichment of subjects with AD in dermotype B. 
Dermotype B was characterized by reduced microbial richness, depletion of 
Cutibacterium acnes, Dermacoccus and Methylobacterium species, 
individual-specific outlier abundance of Staphylococcus species (eg, S 
epidermidis, S capitis, S aureus), and enrichment in metabolic pathways (eg, 
branched chain amino acids and arginine biosynthesis) and virulence genes (eg, 
β-toxin, δ-toxin) that defined a pathogenic ecology. Skin surface and 
circulating host biomarkers exhibited a distinct microbial-associated signature 
that was further reflected in more severe itching, frequent flares, and 
increased disease severity in patients harboring the dermotype B microbiome.
CONCLUSION: We report distinct clusters of microbial profiles that delineate the 
role of microbiome configurations in AD heterogeneity, highlight a mechanism for 
ongoing inflammation, and provide prognostic utility toward microbiome-based 
disease stratification.

OBJECTIVES: The recently discovered tigecycline-inactivating enzyme Tet(X4) can 
confer high-level tigecycline resistance on its hosts, which makes it a public 
health concern. This study focused on isolation and screening of 
Tet(X4)-positive Enterobacteriaceae from the gut microbiota of a cohort of 
healthy individuals in Singapore.
METHODS: MinION and Illumina sequencing was performed to obtain the complete 
genome sequences of Escherichia coli 2EC1-1 and 94EC. Subsequently, 109 human 
faecal samples were screened retrospectively for eravacycline-resistant 
Enterobacteriaceae strains, which were further tested for tet(X4) by PCR. The 
taxonomy of the isolated strains was determined by 16S rRNA gene PCR and Sanger 
sequencing.
RESULTS: Comparative genomic analysis of E. coli 2EC1-1 and 94EC revealed that 
both carry tet(X4), which is encoded by IncI1-type plasmids p2EC1-1 and p94EC-2, 
respectively. Retrospective screening of faecal samples collected from 109 
healthy individuals showed that the faecal carriage rate of Tet(X4)-producing 
Enterobacteriaceae is 10.1% (95% CI = 5.1%-17.3%), suggesting that tet(X4) is 
widely distributed in the gut microbiota of healthy individuals in Singapore.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the 
prevalence of tet(X4) in the gut microbiota of a healthy human cohort, as well 
as the first description of this resistance mechanism outside of China. Our 
findings suggest that surveillance of tet(X4) in community settings is vital to 
monitor the spread of this resistance mechanism.

To determine the duration of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) 
carriage, we studied 21 CPE carriers for »1 year. Mean carriage duration was 86 
days; probability of decolonization in 1 year was 98.5%, suggesting that 
CPE-carriers' status can be reviewed yearly. Prolonged carriage was associated 
with use of antimicrobial drugs.

Loss of diversity in the gut microbiome can persist for extended periods after 
antibiotic treatment, impacting microbiome function, antimicrobial resistance 
and probably host health. Despite widespread antibiotic use, our understanding 
of the species and metabolic functions contributing to gut microbiome recovery 
is limited. Using data from 4 discovery cohorts in 3 continents comprising >500 
microbiome profiles from 117 individuals, we identified 21 bacterial species 
exhibiting robust association with ecological recovery post antibiotic therapy. 
Functional and growth-rate analysis showed that recovery is supported by 
enrichment in specific carbohydrate-degradation and energy-production pathways. 
Association rule mining on 782 microbiome profiles from the MEDUSA database 
enabled reconstruction of the gut microbial 'food web', identifying many 
recovery-associated bacteria as keystone species, with the ability to use host- 
and diet-derived energy sources, and support repopulation of other gut species. 
Experiments in a mouse model recapitulated the ability of recovery-associated 
bacteria (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bifidobacterium adolescentis) to 
promote recovery with synergistic effects, providing a boost of two orders of 
magnitude to microbial abundance in early time points and faster maturation of 
microbial diversity. The identification of specific species and metabolic 
functions promoting recovery opens up opportunities for rationally determining 
pre- and probiotic formulations offering protection from long-term consequences 
of frequent antibiotic usage.

Although disinfection is key to infection control, the colonization patterns and 
resistomes of hospital-environment microbes remain underexplored. We report the 
first extensive genomic characterization of microbiomes, pathogens and 
antibiotic resistance cassettes in a tertiary-care hospital, from repeated 
sampling (up to 1.5 years apart) of 179 sites associated with 45 beds. Deep 
shotgun metagenomics unveiled distinct ecological niches of microbes and 
antibiotic resistance genes characterized by biofilm-forming and 
human-microbiome-influenced environments with corresponding patterns of 
spatiotemporal divergence. Quasi-metagenomics with nanopore sequencing provided 
thousands of high-contiguity genomes, phage and plasmid sequences (>60% novel), 
enabling characterization of resistome and mobilome diversity and dynamic 
architectures in hospital environments. Phylogenetics identified 
multidrug-resistant strains as being widely distributed and stably colonizing 
across sites. Comparisons with clinical isolates indicated that such microbes 
can persist in hospitals for extended periods (>8 years), to opportunistically 
infect patients. These findings highlight the importance of characterizing 
antibiotic resistance reservoirs in hospitals and establish the feasibility of 
systematic surveys to target resources for preventing infections.

BACKGROUND: As more animal studies start to disentangle pathways linking the gut 
microbial ecosystem and neurobehavioral traits, human studies have grown 
rapidly. Many have since investigated the bidirectional communication between 
the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system, specifically on the 
effects of microbial composition on the brain and development.
METHODS: Our review at the initial stage aimed to evaluate literature on gut 
microbial alterations in pediatric neurobehavioral conditions. We searched five 
literature databases (Embase, PubMed, PsychInfo, Scopus, and Medline) and found 
4489 published work. As the mechanisms linking gut microbiota to these 
conditions are divergent, the scope of this review was narrowed to focus on 
describing gut dysbiosis in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
RESULTS: Among the final 26 articles, there was a lack of consistency in the 
reported gut microbiome changes across ASD studies, except for distinguishable 
patterns, within limits, for Prevotella, Firmicutes at the phylum level, 
Clostridiales clusters including Clostridium perfringens, and Bifidobacterium 
species.
CONCLUSIONS: These results were inadequate to confirm a global microbiome change 
in children with ASD and causality could not be inferred to explain the etiology 
of the behaviors associated with ASD. Mechanistic studies are needed to 
elucidate the specific role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of ASD.

Biodiversity is in crisis due to habitat destruction and climate change. The 
conservation of many noncharismatic species is hampered by the lack of data. 
Yet, natural history research-a major source of information on noncharismatic 
species-is in decline. We here suggest a remedy for many mammal species, i.e., 
metagenomic clean-up of fecal samples that are "crowdsourced" during routine 
field surveys. Based on literature data, we estimate that this approach could 
yield natural history information for circa 1,000 species within a decade. 
Metagenomic analysis would simultaneously yield natural history data on diet and 
gut parasites while enhancing our understanding of host genetics, gut 
microbiome, and the functional interactions between traditional and new natural 
history data. We document the power of this approach by carrying out a 
"metagenomic clean-up" on fecal samples collected during a single night of small 
mammal trapping in one of Alfred Wallace's favorite collecting sites.

BACKGROUND: The dynamics of microbial communities is driven by a range of 
interactions from symbiosis to predator-prey relationships, the majority of 
which are poorly understood. With the increasing availability of high-throughput 
microbiome taxonomic profiling data, it is now conceivable to directly learn the 
ecological models that explicitly define microbial interactions and explain 
community dynamics. The applicability of these approaches is severely limited by 
the lack of accurate absolute cell density measurements (biomass).
METHODS: We present a new computational approach that resolves this key 
limitation in the inference of generalized Lotka-Volterra models (gLVMs) by 
coupling biomass estimation and model inference with an expectation-maximization 
algorithm (BEEM).
RESULTS: BEEM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for inferring gLVMs, 
while simultaneously eliminating the need for additional experimental biomass 
data as input. BEEM's application to previously inaccessible public datasets 
(due to the lack of biomass data) allowed us to construct ecological models of 
microbial communities in the human gut on a per-individual basis, revealing 
personalized dynamics and keystone species.
CONCLUSIONS: BEEM addresses a key bottleneck in "systems analysis" of 
microbiomes by enabling accurate inference of ecological models from high 
throughput sequencing data without the need for experimental biomass 
measurements.

BACKGROUND: Acrylic acid (AA) is a widely used commodity chemical derived from 
non-renewable fossil fuel sources. Alternative microbial-based production 
methodologies are being developed with the aim of providing "green" acrylic 
acid. These initiatives will benefit from component sensing tools that 
facilitate rapid and easy detection of in vivo AA production.
RESULTS: We developed a novel transcriptional sensor facilitating in vivo 
detection of acrylic acid (AA). RNAseq analysis of Escherichia coli exposed to 
sub-lethal doses of acrylic acid identified a selectively responsive promoter 
(PyhcN) that was cloned upstream of the eGFP gene. In the presence of AA, eGFP 
expression in E. coli cells harbouring the sensing construct was readily 
observable by fluorescence read-out. Low concentrations of AA (500 μM) could be 
detected whilst the closely related lactic and 3-hydroxy propionic acids failed 
to activate the sensor. We further used the developed AA-biosensor for in vivo 
FACS-based screening and identification of amidase mutants with improved 
catalytic properties for deamination of acrylamide to acrylic acid.
CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptional AA sensor developed in this study will benefit 
strain, enzyme and pathway engineering initiatives targeting the efficient 
formation of bio-acrylic acid.

Characterization of microbiomes has been enabled by high-throughput metagenomic 
sequencing. However, existing methods are not designed to combine reads from 
short- and long-read technologies. We present a hybrid metagenomic assembler 
named OPERA-MS that integrates assembly-based metagenome clustering with 
repeat-aware, exact scaffolding to accurately assemble complex communities. 
Evaluation using defined in vitro and virtual gut microbiomes revealed that 
OPERA-MS assembles metagenomes with greater base pair accuracy than long-read 
(>5×; Canu), higher contiguity than short-read (~10× NGA50; MEGAHIT, IDBA-UD, 
metaSPAdes) and fewer assembly errors than non-metagenomic hybrid assemblers 
(2×; hybridSPAdes). OPERA-MS provides strain-resolved assembly in the presence 
of multiple genomes of the same species, high-quality reference genomes for rare 
species (<1%) with ~9× long-read coverage and near-complete genomes with higher 
coverage. We used OPERA-MS to assemble 28 gut metagenomes of antibiotic-treated 
patients, and showed that the inclusion of long nanopore reads produces more 
contiguous assemblies (200× improvement over short-read assemblies), including 
more than 80 closed plasmid or phage sequences and a new 263 kbp jumbo phage. 
High-quality hybrid assemblies enable an exquisitely detailed view of the gut 
resistome in human patients.

The effectiveness of most cancer targeted therapies is short-lived. Tumors often 
develop resistance that might be overcome with drug combinations. However, the 
number of possible combinations is vast, necessitating data-driven approaches to 
find optimal patient-specific treatments. Here we report AstraZeneca's large 
drug combination dataset, consisting of 11,576 experiments from 910 combinations 
across 85 molecularly characterized cancer cell lines, and results of a DREAM 
Challenge to evaluate computational strategies for predicting synergistic drug 
pairs and biomarkers. 160 teams participated to provide a comprehensive 
methodological development and benchmarking. Winning methods incorporate prior 
knowledge of drug-target interactions. Synergy is predicted with an accuracy 
matching biological replicates for >60% of combinations. However, 20% of drug 
combinations are poorly predicted by all methods. Genomic rationale for synergy 
predictions are identified, including ADAM17 inhibitor antagonism when combined 
with PIK3CB/D inhibition contrasting to synergy when combined with other 
PI3K-pathway inhibitors in PIK3CA mutant cells.

Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses are clinically important members of the 
Flaviviridae family with an 11 kb positive strand RNA genome that folds to 
enable virus function. Here, we perform structure and interaction mapping on 
four DENV and ZIKV strains inside virions and in infected cells. Comparative 
analysis of SHAPE reactivities across serotypes nominates potentially functional 
regions that are highly structured, conserved, and contain low synonymous 
mutation rates. Interaction mapping by SPLASH identifies many pair-wise 
interactions, 40% of which form alternative structures, suggesting extensive 
structural heterogeneity. Analysis of shared interactions between serotypes 
reveals a conserved macro-organization whereby interactions can be preserved at 
physical locations beyond sequence identities. We further observe that 
longer-range interactions are preferentially disrupted inside cells, and show 
the importance of new interactions in virus fitness. These findings deepen our 
understanding of Flavivirus genome organization and serve as a resource for 
designing therapeutics in targeting RNA viruses.

BACKGROUND: Even though human sweat is odorless, bacterial growth and 
decomposition of specific odor precursors in it is believed to give rise to body 
odor in humans. While mechanisms of odor generation have been widely studied in 
adults, little is known for teenagers and pre-pubescent children who have 
distinct sweat composition from immature apocrine and sebaceous glands, but are 
arguably more susceptible to the social and psychological impact of malodor.
RESULTS: We integrated information from whole microbiome analysis of multiple 
skin sites (underarm, neck, and head) and multiple time points (1 h and 8 h 
after bath), analyzing 180 samples in total to perform the largest 
metagenome-wide association study to date on malodor. Significant positive 
correlations were observed between odor intensity and the relative abundance of 
Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Cutibacterium avidum, as 
well as negative correlation with Acinetobacter schindleri and Cutibacterium 
species. Metabolic pathway analysis highlighted the association of isovaleric 
and acetic acid production (sour odor) from enriched S. epidermidis (teen 
underarm) and S. hominis (child neck) enzymes and sulfur production from 
Staphylococcus species (teen underarm) with odor intensity, in good agreement 
with observed odor characteristics in pre-pubescent children and teenagers. 
Experiments with cultures on human and artificial sweat confirmed the ability of 
S. hominis and S. epidermidis to independently produce malodor with distinct 
odor characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: These results showcase the power of skin metagenomics to study 
host-microbial co-metabolic interactions, identifying distinct pathways for odor 
generation from sweat in pre-pubescent children and teenagers and highlighting 
key enzymatic targets for intervention.

Understanding the composition and clinical importance of the fungal mycobiome 
was recently identified as a key topic in a "research priorities" consensus 
statement for bronchiectasis.Patients were recruited as part of the CAMEB study: 
an international multicentre cross-sectional Cohort of Asian and Matched 
European Bronchiectasis patients. The mycobiome was determined in 238 patients 
by targeted amplicon shotgun sequencing of the 18S-28S rRNA internally 
transcribed spacer regions ITS1 and ITS2. Specific quantitative PCR for 
detection of and conidial quantification for a range of airway Aspergillus 
species was performed. Sputum galactomannan, Aspergillus specific IgE, IgG and 
TARC (thymus and activation regulated chemokine) levels were measured 
systemically and associated to clinical outcomes.The bronchiectasis mycobiome is 
distinct and characterised by specific fungal genera, including Aspergillus, 
Cryptococcus and ClavisporaAspergillus fumigatus (in Singapore/Kuala Lumpur) and 
Aspergillus terreus (in Dundee) dominated profiles, the latter associating with 
exacerbations. High frequencies of Aspergillus-associated disease including 
sensitisation and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis were detected. Each 
revealed distinct mycobiome profiles, and associated with more severe disease, 
poorer pulmonary function and increased exacerbations.The pulmonary mycobiome is 
of clinical relevance in bronchiectasis. Screening for Aspergillus-associated 
disease should be considered even in apparently stable patients.

MOTIVATION: As we move toward an era of precision medicine, the ability to 
predict patient-specific drug responses in cancer based on molecular information 
such as gene expression data represents both an opportunity and a challenge. In 
particular, methods are needed that can accommodate the high-dimensionality of 
data to learn interpretable models capturing drug response mechanisms, as well 
as providing robust predictions across datasets.
RESULTS: We propose a method based on ideas from 'recommender systems' (CaDRReS) 
that predicts cancer drug responses for unseen cell-lines/patients based on 
learning projections for drugs and cell-lines into a latent 'pharmacogenomic' 
space. Comparisons with other proposed approaches for this problem based on 
large public datasets (CCLE and GDSC) show that CaDRReS provides consistently 
good models and robust predictions even across unseen patient-derived cell-line 
datasets. Analysis of the pharmacogenomic spaces inferred by CaDRReS also 
suggests that they can be used to understand drug mechanisms, identify cellular 
subtypes and further characterize drug-pathway associations.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code and datasets are available at 
https://github.com/CSB5/CaDRReS.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics

DNA barcodes are useful for species discovery and species identification, but 
obtaining barcodes currently requires a well-equipped molecular laboratory and 
is time-consuming, and/or expensive. We here address these issues by developing 
a barcoding pipeline for Oxford Nanopore MinION™ and demonstrating that one flow 
cell can generate barcodes for ~500 specimens despite the high basecall error 
rates of MinION™ reads. The pipeline overcomes these errors by first summarizing 
all reads for the same tagged amplicon as a consensus barcode. Consensus 
barcodes are overall mismatch-free but retain indel errors that are concentrated 
in homopolymeric regions. They are addressed with an optional error correction 
pipeline that is based on conserved amino acid motifs from publicly available 
barcodes. The effectiveness of this pipeline is documented by analysing reads 
from three MinION™ runs that represent three different stages of MinION™ 
development. They generated data for (i) 511 specimens of a mixed Diptera 
sample, (ii) 575 specimens of ants and (iii) 50 specimens of Chironomidae. The 
run based on the latest chemistry yielded MinION™ barcodes for 490 of the 511 
specimens which were assessed against reference Sanger barcodes (N = 471). 
Overall, the MinION™ barcodes have an accuracy of 99.3%-100% with the number of 
ambiguous bases after correction ranging from <0.01% to 1.5% depending on which 
correction pipeline is used. We demonstrate that it requires ~2 hr of sequencing 
to gather all information needed for obtaining reliable barcodes for most 
specimens (>90%). We estimate that up to 1,000 barcodes can be generated in one 
flow cell and that the cost per barcode can be <USD 2.

Identifying molecular cancer drivers is critical for precision oncology. 
Multiple advanced algorithms to identify drivers now exist, but systematic 
attempts to combine and optimize them on large datasets are few. We report a 
PanCancer and PanSoftware analysis spanning 9,423 tumor exomes (comprising all 
33 of The Cancer Genome Atlas projects) and using 26 computational tools to 
catalog driver genes and mutations. We identify 299 driver genes with 
implications regarding their anatomical sites and cancer/cell types. Sequence- 
and structure-based analyses identified >3,400 putative missense driver 
mutations supported by multiple lines of evidence. Experimental validation 
confirmed 60%-85% of predicted mutations as likely drivers. We found that >300 
MSI tumors are associated with high PD-1/PD-L1, and 57% of tumors analyzed 
harbor putative clinically actionable events. Our study represents the most 
comprehensive discovery of cancer genes and mutations to date and will serve as 
a blueprint for future biological and clinical endeavors.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has catalyzed systematic characterization of 
diverse genomic alterations underlying human cancers. At this historic junction 
marking the completion of genomic characterization of over 11,000 tumors from 33 
cancer types, we present our current understanding of the molecular processes 
governing oncogenesis. We illustrate our insights into cancer through synthesis 
of the findings of the TCGA PanCancer Atlas project on three facets of 
oncogenesis: (1) somatic driver mutations, germline pathogenic variants, and 
their interactions in the tumor; (2) the influence of the tumor genome and 
epigenome on transcriptome and proteome; and (3) the relationship between tumor 
and the microenvironment, including implications for drugs targeting driver 
events and immunotherapies. These results will anchor future characterization of 
rare and common tumor types, primary and relapsed tumors, and cancers across 
ancestry groups and will guide the deployment of clinical genomic sequencing.

RNAs are well-suited to act as cellular sensors that detect and respond to 
metabolite changes in the environment, due to their ability to fold into complex 
structures. Here, we introduce a genome-wide strategy called PARCEL that 
experimentally identifies RNA aptamers in vitro, in a high-throughput manner. By 
applying PARCEL to a collection of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, we have 
revealed 58 new RNA aptamers to three key metabolites, greatly expanding the 
list of natural RNA aptamers. The newly identified RNA aptamers exhibit 
significant sequence conservation, are highly structured and show an unexpected 
prevalence in coding regions. We identified a prokaryotic precursor tmRNA that 
binds vitamin B2 (FMN) to facilitate its maturation, as well as eukaryotic mRNAs 
that bind and respond to FMN, suggesting FMN as the second RNA-binding ligand to 
affect eukaryotic expression. PARCEL results show that RNA-based sensing and 
gene regulation is more widespread than previously appreciated in different 
organisms.

Existing cancer driver prediction methods are based on very different 
assumptions and each of them can detect only a particular subset of driver 
genes. Here we perform a comprehensive assessment of 18 driver prediction 
methods on more than 3,400 tumor samples from 15 cancer types, all to determine 
their suitability in guiding precision medicine efforts. We categorized these 
methods into five groups: functional impact on proteins in general (FI) or 
specific to cancer (FIC), cohort-based analysis for recurrent mutations (CBA), 
mutations with expression correlation (MEC), and methods that use gene 
interaction network-based analysis (INA). The performance of driver prediction 
methods varied considerably, with concordance with a gold standard varying from 
9% to 68%. FI methods showed relatively poor performance (concordance <22%), 
while CBA methods provided conservative results but required large sample sizes 
for high sensitivity. INA methods, through the integration of genomic and 
transcriptomic data, and FIC methods, by training cancer-specific models, 
provided the best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. As the methods 
were found to predict different subsets of driver genes, we propose a novel 
consensus-based approach, ConsensusDriver, which significantly improves the 
quality of predictions (20% increase in sensitivity) in patient subgroups or 
even individual patients. Consensus-based methods like ConsensusDriver promise 
to harness the strengths of different driver prediction paradigms.Significance: 
These findings assess state-of-the-art cancer driver prediction methods and 
develop a new and improved consensus-based approach for use in precision 
oncology. Cancer Res; 78(1); 290-301. ©2017 AACR.

OBJECTIVE: Cell-free DNA from maternal plasma can be used for non-invasive 
prenatal testing for aneuploidies and single gene disorders, and also has 
applications as a biomarker for monitoring high-risk pregnancies, such as those 
at risk of pre-eclampsia. On average, the fractional cell-free fetal DNA 
concentration in plasma is approximately 15%, but can vary from less than 4% to 
greater than 30%. Although quantification of cell-free fetal DNA is 
straightforward in the case of a male fetus, there is no universal fetal marker; 
in a female fetus measurement is more challenging. We have developed a panel of 
multiplexed insertion/deletion polymorphisms that can measure fetal fraction in 
all pregnancies in a simple, targeted sequencing reaction.
METHODS: A multiplex panel of primers was designed for 35 indels plus a ZFX/ZFY 
amplicon. cfDNA was extracted from plasma from 157 pregnant women, and maternal 
genomic DNA was extracted for 20 of these samples for panel validation. 
Sixty-one samples from pregnancies with a male fetus were subjected to whole 
genome sequencing on the Ion Proton sequencing platform, and fetal fraction 
derived from Y chromosome counts was compared to fetal fraction measured using 
the indel panel. A total of 157 cell-free DNA samples were sequenced using the 
indel panel, and informativity was assessed, along with the proportion of fetal 
DNA.
RESULTS: Using gDNA we optimised the indel panel, removing amplicons giving rise 
to PCR bias. Good correlation was found between fetal fraction using indels and 
using whole genome sequencing of the Y chromosome (Spearmans r = 0.69). A median 
of 12 indels were informative per sample. The indel panel was informative in 
157/157 cases (mean fetal fraction 14.4% (±0.58%)).
CONCLUSIONS: Using our targeted next generation sequencing panel we can readily 
assess the fetal DNA percentage in male and female pregnancies.

BACKGROUND: Viral populations are complex, dynamic, and fast evolving. The 
evolution of groups of closely related viruses in a competitive environment is 
termed quasispecies. To fully understand the role that quasispecies play in 
viral evolution, characterizing the trajectories of viral genotypes in an 
evolving population is the key. In particular, long-range haplotype information 
for thousands of individual viruses is critical; yet generating this information 
is non-trivial. Popular deep sequencing methods generate relatively short reads 
that do not preserve linkage information, while third generation sequencing 
methods have higher error rates that make detection of low frequency mutations a 
bioinformatics challenge. Here we applied BAsE-Seq, an Illumina-based 
single-virion sequencing technology, to eight samples from four chronic 
hepatitis B (CHB) patients - once before antiviral treatment and once after 
viral rebound due to resistance.
RESULTS: With single-virion sequencing, we obtained 248-8796 single-virion 
sequences per sample, which allowed us to find evidence for both hard and soft 
selective sweeps. We were able to reconstruct population demographic history 
that was independently verified by clinically collected data. We further 
verified four of the samples independently through PacBio SMRT and Illumina 
Pooled deep sequencing.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we showed that single-virion sequencing yields insight 
into viral evolution and population dynamics in an efficient and high throughput 
manner. We believe that single-virion sequencing is widely applicable to the 
study of viral evolution in the context of drug resistance and host adaptation, 
allows differentiation between soft or hard selective sweeps, and may be useful 
in the reconstruction of intra-host viral population demographic history.

Durian (Durio zibethinus) is a Southeast Asian tropical plant known for its 
hefty, spine-covered fruit and sulfury and onion-like odor. Here we present a 
draft genome assembly of D. zibethinus, representing the third plant genus in 
the Malvales order and first in the Helicteroideae subfamily to be sequenced. 
Single-molecule sequencing and chromosome contact maps enabled assembly of the 
highly heterozygous durian genome at chromosome-scale resolution. Transcriptomic 
analysis showed upregulation of sulfur-, ethylene-, and lipid-related pathways 
in durian fruits. We observed paleopolyploidization events shared by durian and 
cotton and durian-specific gene expansions in MGL (methionine γ-lyase), 
associated with production of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). MGL and the 
ethylene-related gene ACS (aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase) were 
upregulated in fruits concomitantly with their downstream metabolites (VSCs and 
ethylene), suggesting a potential association between ethylene biosynthesis and 
methionine regeneration via the Yang cycle. The durian genome provides a 
resource for tropical fruit biology and agronomy.

Methods for assembly, taxonomic profiling and binning are key to interpreting 
metagenome data, but a lack of consensus about benchmarking complicates 
performance assessment. The Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation 
(CAMI) challenge has engaged the global developer community to benchmark their 
programs on highly complex and realistic data sets, generated from ∼700 newly 
sequenced microorganisms and ∼600 novel viruses and plasmids and representing 
common experimental setups. Assembly and genome binning programs performed well 
for species represented by individual genomes but were substantially affected by 
the presence of related strains. Taxonomic profiling and binning programs were 
proficient at high taxonomic ranks, with a notable performance decrease below 
family level. Parameter settings markedly affected performance, underscoring 
their importance for program reproducibility. The CAMI results highlight current 
challenges but also provide a roadmap for software selection to answer specific 
research questions.

The gut microbiota possesses diverse metabolic activities, but its contribution 
toward heterogeneous toxicological responses is poorly understood. In this 
study, we investigated the role of the liver-gut microbiota axis in underpinning 
the hepatotoxicity of tacrine. We employed an integrated strategy combining 
pharmacokinetics, toxicology, metabonomics, genomics, and metagenomics to 
elucidate and validate the mechanism of tacrine-induced hepatotoxicity in Lister 
hooded rats. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats demonstrated 3.3-fold higher 
systemic exposure to tacrine in strong responders that experienced 
transaminitis, revealing enhanced enterohepatic recycling of deglucuronidated 
tacrine in this subgroup, not attributable to variation in hepatic disposition 
gene expression. Metabonomic studies implicated variations in gut microbial 
activities that mapped onto tacrine-induced transaminitis. Metagenomics 
delineated greater deglucuronidation capabilities in strong responders, based on 
differential gut microbial composition (e.g., Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and 
Enterobacteriaceae) and approximately 9% higher β-glucuronidase gene abundance 
compared with nonresponders. In the validation study, coadministration with oral 
β-glucuronidase derived from Escherichia coli and pretreatment with vancomycin 
and imipenem significantly modulated the susceptibility to tacrine-induced 
transaminitis in vivo.
CONCLUSION: This study establishes pertinent gut microbial influences in 
modifying the hepatotoxicity of tacrine, providing insights for personalized 
medicine initiatives. (Hepatology 2018;67:282-295).

The vast burden of cryptococcal meningitis occurs in immunosuppressed patients, 
driven by HIV, and is caused by Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii. We 
previously reported cryptococcal meningitis in Vietnam arising atypically in HIV 
uninfected, apparently immunocompetent patients, caused by a single amplified 
fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) cluster of C. neoformans var. grubii (VNIγ). 
This variant was less common in HIV infected individuals; it remains unclear why 
this lineage is associated with apparently immunocompetent patients. To study 
this host tropism we aimed to further our understanding of clinical phenotype 
and genomic variation within Vietnamese C. neoformans var. grubii. After 
performing MLST on C. neoformans clinical isolates we identified 14 sequence 
types (STs); ST5 correlated with the VNIγ cluster. We next compared clinical 
phenotype by lineage and found HIV infected patients with cryptococcal 
meningitis caused by ST5 organisms were significantly more likely to have 
lymphadenopathy (11% vs. 4%, p = 0.05 Fisher's exact test) and higher blood 
lymphocyte count (median 0.76 versus 0.55 X109 cells/L, p = 0.001, 
Kruskal-Wallis test). Furthermore, survivors of ST5 infections had evidence of 
worse disability outcomes at 70 days (72.7% (40/55) in ST5 infections versus 
57.1% (52/91) non-ST5 infections (OR 2.11, 95%CI 1.01 to 4.41), p = 0.046). To 
further investigate the relationship between strain and disease phenotype we 
performed genome sequencing on eight Vietnamese C. neoformans var. grubii. Eight 
genome assemblies exhibited >99% nucleotide sequence identity and we identified 
165 kbp of lineage specific to Vietnamese isolates. ST5 genomes harbored several 
strain specific regions, incorporating 19 annotated coding sequences and eight 
hypothetical proteins. These regions included a phenolic acid decarboxylase, a 
DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicase 26, oxoprolinases, a taurine catabolism 
dioxygenase, a zinc finger protein, membrane transport proteins and various drug 
transporters. Our work outlines the complexity of genomic pathogenicity in 
cryptococcal infections and identifies a number of gene candidates that may aid 
the disaggregation of the pathways associated with the pathogenesis of 
Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii.

Knowing how RNAs interact with themselves and with others is key to 
understanding RNA based gene regulation in the cell. While examples of RNA-RNA 
interactions such as microRNA-mRNA interactions have been shown to regulate gene 
expression, the full extent to which RNA interactions occur in the cell is still 
unknown. Previous methods to study RNA interactions have primarily focused on 
subsets of RNAs that are interacting with a particular protein or RNA species. 
Here, we detail a method named Sequencing of Psoralen crosslinked, Ligated, and 
Selected Hybrids (SPLASH) that allows genome-wide capture of RNA interactions in 
vivo in an unbiased manner. SPLASH utilizes in vivo crosslinking, proximity 
ligation, and high throughput sequencing to identify intramolecular and 
intermolecular RNA base-pairing partners globally. SPLASH can be applied to 
different organisms including bacteria, yeast and human cells, as well as 
diverse cellular conditions to facilitate the understanding of the dynamics of 
RNA organization under diverse cellular contexts. The entire experimental SPLASH 
protocol takes about 5 days to complete and the computational workflow takes 
about 7 days to complete.

Effective development of host cells for therapeutic protein production is 
hampered by the poor characterization of cellular transfection. Here, we 
employed a multi-omics-based systems biotechnology approach to elucidate the 
genotypic and phenotypic differences between a wild-type and recombinant 
antibody-producing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. At the genomic level, 
we observed extensive rearrangements in specific targeted loci linked to 
transgene integration sites. Transcriptional re-wiring of DNA damage repair and 
cellular metabolism in the antibody producer, via changes in gene copy numbers, 
was also detected. Subsequent integration of transcriptomic data with a 
genome-scale metabolic model showed a substantial increase in energy metabolism 
in the antibody producer. Metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics analyses 
revealed an elevation in long-chain lipid species, potentially associated with 
protein transport and secretion requirements, and a surprising stability of 
N-glycosylation profiles between both cell lines. Overall, the proposed 
knowledge-based systems biotechnology framework can further accelerate mammalian 
cell-line engineering in a targeted manner.

INTRODUCTION: Enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive bacterium associated with 
endodontic infections and is capable of forming biofilms that can confer drug 
resistance to the bacterium, resulting in treatment failure. Current knowledge 
on E. faecalis drug resistance is of a limited and conflicting nature. The 
present study examined the genetic basis of E. faecalis biofilm formation and 
drug resistance using a RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)-based transcriptome approach.
METHODS: Eighteen clinical isolates of E. faecalis were screened for their 
biofilm formation abilities using the crystal violet assay, colony counting, and 
confocal imaging. Selected isolates were then evaluated for antibiotic 
susceptibility in planktonic and biofilm growth modes followed by RNA-Seq 
analysis of E. faecalis planktonic, biofilm, and vancomycin-treated biofilm 
samples and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes mapping in order to identify 
genes associated with biofilm formation and drug resistance of E. faecalis.
RESULTS: All 18 clinical isolates retained biofilm formation ability and were 
classified as strong, weak, or laboratory American Type Culture Collection 
strainlike biofilm formers. Interestingly, both the strong and weak 
biofilm-forming isolates were uniformly resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin 
at the treated concentrations (256-4096 μg/mL). RNA-Seq analysis of these 
isolates identified a total of 163 and 101 differentially regulated genes in 
planktonic versus biofilm and vancomycin-treated biofilm versus biofilm 
comparisons, respectively, with significant differences in arsenic resistance 
operon genes arsR and arsD, sporulation regulatory gene paiA, ABC drug 
transporter classes, and penicillin-binding proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: The present transcriptomic study revealed putative genes associated 
with E. faecalis biofilm formation and drug resistance, which will provide a 
foundation for improved therapeutic strategies against E. faecalis infections in 
the future.

BACKGROUND: Lignin is a potential biorefinery feedstock for the production of 
value-added chemicals including vanillin. A huge amount of lignin is produced as 
a by-product of the paper industry, while cellulosic components of plant biomass 
are utilized for the production of paper pulp. In spite of vast potential, 
lignin remains the least exploited component of plant biomass due to its 
extremely complex and heterogenous structure. Several enzymes have been reported 
to have lignin-degrading properties and could be potentially used in lignin 
biorefining if their catalytic properties could be improved by enzyme 
engineering. The much needed improvement of lignin-degrading enzymes by 
high-throughput selection techniques such as directed evolution is currently 
limited, as robust methods for detecting the conversion of lignin to desired 
small molecules are not available.
RESULTS: We identified a vanillin-inducible promoter by RNAseq analysis of 
Escherichia coli cells treated with a sublethal dose of vanillin and developed a 
genetically programmed vanillin-sensing cell by placing the 'very green 
fluorescent protein' gene under the control of this promoter. Fluorescence of 
the biosensing cell is enhanced significantly when grown in the presence of 
vanillin and is readily visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The use of 
fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis further enhances the sensitivity, 
enabling dose-dependent detection of as low as 200 µM vanillin. The biosensor is 
highly specific to vanillin and no major response is elicited by the presence of 
lignin, lignin model compound, DMSO, vanillin analogues or non-specific toxic 
chemicals.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed an engineered E. coli cell that can detect vanillin at 
a concentration as low as 200 µM. The vanillin-sensing cell did not show 
cross-reactivity towards lignin or major lignin degradation products including 
vanillin analogues. This engineered E. coli cell could potentially be used as a 
host cell for screening lignin-degrading enzymes that can convert lignin to 
vanillin.

The assembly of long reads from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore 
Technologies typically requires resource-intensive error-correction and 
consensus-generation steps to obtain high-quality assemblies. We show that the 
error-correction step can be omitted and that high-quality consensus sequences 
can be generated efficiently with a SIMD-accelerated, partial-order 
alignment-based, stand-alone consensus module called Racon. Based on tests with 
PacBio and Oxford Nanopore data sets, we show that Racon coupled with miniasm 
enables consensus genomes with similar or better quality than state-of-the-art 
methods while being an order of magnitude faster.

Whole metagenome analysis has the potential to reveal functional triggers of 
skin diseases, but issues of cost, robustness and sampling efficacy have limited 
its application. Here, we have established an alternative, clinically practical 
and robust metagenomic analysis protocol and applied it to 80 skin microbiome 
samples epidemiologically stratified for atopic dermatitis (AD). We have 
identified distinct non-flare, baseline skin microbiome signatures enriched for 
Streptococcus and Gemella but depleted for Dermacoccus in AD-prone versus normal 
healthy skin. Bacterial challenge assays using keratinocytes and 
monocyte-derived dendritic cells established distinct IL-1-mediated, innate and 
Th1-mediated adaptive immune responses with Staphylococcus aureus and 
Staphylococcus epidermidis. Bacterial differences were complemented by 
perturbations in the eukaryotic community and functional shifts in the 
microbiome-wide gene repertoire, which could exacerbate a dry and alkaline 
phenotype primed for pathogen growth and inflammation in AD-susceptible skin. 
These findings provide insights into how the skin microbial community, skin 
surface microenvironment and immune system cross-modulate each other, escalating 
the destructive feedback cycle between them that leads to AD flare.

BACKGROUND: Nanopore sequencing provides a rapid, cheap and portable real-time 
sequencing platform with the potential to revolutionize genomics. However, 
several applications are limited by relatively high single-read error rates 
(>10 %), including RNA-seq, haplotype sequencing and 16S sequencing.
RESULTS: We developed the Intramolecular-ligated Nanopore Consensus Sequencing 
(INC-Seq) as a strategy for obtaining long and accurate nanopore reads, starting 
with low input DNA. Applying INC-Seq for 16S rRNA-based bacterial profiling 
generated full-length amplicon sequences with a median accuracy >97 %.
CONCLUSIONS: INC-Seq reads enabled accurate species-level classification, 
identification of species at 0.1 % abundance and robust quantification of 
relative abundances, providing a cheap and effective approach for pathogen 
detection and microbiome profiling on the MinION system.

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is the primary cancer of the bile duct system. The role 
of bile duct tissue microbiomes in CCA tumorigenesis is unestablished. To 
address this, sixty primary CCA tumors and matched normals, from both liver 
fluke (Opisthorchis viverrini) associated (OVa, n=28) and non-O. viverrini 
associated (non-OVa, n=32) cancers, were profiled using high-throughput 16S rRNA 
sequencing. A distinct, tissue-specific microbiome dominated by the bacterial 
families Dietziaceae, Pseudomonadaceae and Oxalobacteraceae was observed in bile 
duct tissues. Systemic perturbation of the microbiome was noted in tumor and 
paired normal samples (vs non-cancer normals) for several bacterial families 
with a significant increase in Stenotrophomonas species distinguishing tumors vs 
paired normals. Comparison of parasite associated (OVa) vs non-associated 
(non-OVa) groups identified enrichment for specific enteric bacteria 
(Bifidobacteriaceae, Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae). One of the 
enriched families, Bifidobacteriaceae, was found to be dominant in the O. 
viverrini microbiome, providing a mechanistic link to the parasite. Functional 
analysis and comparison of CCA microbiomes revealed higher potential for 
producing bile acids and ammonia in OVa tissues, linking the altered microbiota 
to carcinogenesis. These results define how the unique microbial communities 
resident in the bile duct, parasitic infections and the tissue microenvironment 
can influence each other, and contribute to cancer.

MOTIVATION: Microbial consortia are frequently defined by numerous interactions 
within the community that are key to understanding their function. While 
microbial interactions have been extensively studied experimentally, information 
regarding them is dispersed in the scientific literature. As manual collation is 
an infeasible option, automated data processing tools are needed to make this 
information easily accessible.
RESULTS: We present @MInter, an automated information extraction system based on 
Support Vector Machines to analyze paper abstracts and infer microbial 
interactions. @MInter was trained and tested on a manually curated gold standard 
dataset of 735 species interactions and 3917 annotated abstracts, constructed as 
part of this study. Cross-validation analysis showed that @MInter was able to 
detect abstracts pertaining to one or more microbial interactions with high 
specificity (specificity = 95%, AUC = 0.97). Despite challenges in identifying 
specific microbial interactions in an abstract (interaction level recall = 95%, 
precision = 25%), @MInter was shown to reduce annotator workload 13-fold 
compared to alternate approaches. Applying @MInter to 175 bacterial species 
abundant on human skin, we identified a network of 357 literature-reported 
microbial interactions, demonstrating its utility for the study of microbial 
communities.

Identifying pairwise RNA-RNA interactions is key to understanding how RNAs fold 
and interact with other RNAs inside the cell. We present a high-throughput 
approach, sequencing of psoralen crosslinked, ligated, and selected hybrids 
(SPLASH), that maps pairwise RNA interactions in vivo with high sensitivity and 
specificity, genome-wide. Applying SPLASH to human and yeast transcriptomes 
revealed the diversity and dynamics of thousands of long-range intra- and 
intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions. Our analysis highlighted key structural 
features of RNA classes, including the modular organization of mRNAs, its impact 
on translation and decay, and the enrichment of long-range interactions in 
noncoding RNAs. Additionally, intermolecular mRNA interactions were organized 
into network clusters and were remodeled during cellular differentiation. We 
also identified hundreds of known and new snoRNA-rRNA binding sites, expanding 
our knowledge of rRNA biogenesis. These results highlight the underexplored 
complexity of RNA interactomes and pave the way to better understanding how RNA 
organization impacts biology.

The assembly of large, repeat-rich eukaryotic genomes represents a significant 
challenge in genomics. While long-read technologies have made the high-quality 
assembly of small, microbial genomes increasingly feasible, data generation can 
be expensive for larger genomes. OPERA-LG is a scalable, exact algorithm for the 
scaffold assembly of large, repeat-rich genomes, out-performing state-of-the-art 
programs for scaffold correctness and contiguity. It provides a rigorous 
framework for scaffolding of repetitive sequences and a systematic approach for 
combining data from different second-generation and third-generation sequencing 
technologies. OPERA-LG provides an avenue for systematic augmentation and 
improvement of thousands of existing draft eukaryotic genome assemblies.

Realizing the democratic promise of nanopore sequencing requires the development 
of new bioinformatics approaches to deal with its specific error 
characteristics. Here we present GraphMap, a mapping algorithm designed to 
analyse nanopore sequencing reads, which progressively refines candidate 
alignments to robustly handle potentially high-error rates and a fast graph 
traversal to align long reads with speed and high precision (>95%). Evaluation 
on MinION sequencing data sets against short- and long-read mappers indicates 
that GraphMap increases mapping sensitivity by 10-80% and maps >95% of bases. 
GraphMap alignments enabled single-nucleotide variant calling on the human 
genome with increased sensitivity (15%) over the next best mapper, precise 
detection of structural variants from length 100 bp to 4 kbp, and species and 
strain-specific identification of pathogens using MinION reads. GraphMap is 
available open source under the MIT license at

Microorganisms play a vital role in various ecosystems and characterizing 
interactions between them is an essential step towards understanding the 
organization and function of microbial communities. Computational prediction has 
recently become a widely used approach to investigate microbial interactions. We 
provide a thorough review of emerging computational methods organized by the 
type of data they employ. We highlight three major challenges in inferring 
interactions using metagenomic survey data and discuss the underlying 
assumptions and mathematics of interaction inference algorithms. In addition, we 
review interaction prediction methods relying on metabolic pathways, which are 
increasingly used to reveal mechanisms of interactions. Furthermore, we also 
emphasize the importance of mining the scientific literature for microbial 
interactions - a largely overlooked data source for experimentally validated 
interactions.

BACKGROUND: Resolution of complex repeat structures and rearrangements in the 
assembly and analysis of large eukaryotic genomes is often aided by a 
combination of high-throughput sequencing and genome-mapping technologies (for 
example, optical restriction mapping). In particular, mapping technologies can 
generate sparse maps of large DNA fragments (150 kilo base pairs (kbp) to 2 Mbp) 
and thus provide a unique source of information for disambiguating complex 
rearrangements in cancer genomes. Despite their utility, combining 
high-throughput sequencing and mapping technologies has been challenging because 
of the lack of efficient and sensitive map-alignment algorithms for robustly 
aligning error-prone maps to sequences.
RESULTS: We introduce a novel seed-and-extend glocal (short for global-local) 
alignment method, OPTIMA (and a sliding-window extension for overlap alignment, 
OPTIMA-Overlap), which is the first to create indexes for continuous-valued 
mapping data while accounting for mapping errors. We also present a novel 
statistical model, agnostic with respect to technology-dependent error rates, 
for conservatively evaluating the significance of alignments without relying on 
expensive permutation-based tests.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that OPTIMA and OPTIMA-Overlap outperform other 
state-of-the-art approaches (1.6-2 times more sensitive) and are more efficient 
(170-200 %) and precise in their alignments (nearly 99 % precision). These 
advantages are independent of the quality of the data, suggesting that our 
indexing approach and statistical evaluation are robust, provide improved 
sensitivity and guarantee high precision.

The precancerous lesion known as Barrett's oesophagus can evolve to oesophageal 
adenocarcinoma in decades-long processes of regenerative growth. Here we report 
the isolation and propagation of distinct, patient-matched stem cells of 
Barrett's, gastric and oesophageal epithelia that yield divergent tumour types 
following in vitro transformation and xenografting. Genomic analyses reveal a 
broad mutational spectrum unique to Barrett's stem cells that likely reflects 
their risk for oncogenesis. Remarkably, 25% of cases show no cancer-related 
genomic changes, suggesting that Barrett's initiates without driver mutations. 
Most cases, however, sustain patterns of deletions almost identical to 
adenocarcinoma though tumour-associated gene amplifications were absent. 
Notably, those suspected of low-grade dysplasia have p53 mutations or undergo 
amplifications of proto-oncogenes and receptor tyrosine kinases, implicating 
these events in lethal transitions. Our findings suggest paths for the 
initiation and progression of Barrett's and define a discrete stem cell 
underlying its regenerative growth whose eradication could prevent oesophageal 
adenocarcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have changed our 
understanding of the variability of the human genome. However, the 
identification of genome structural variations based on NGS approaches with read 
lengths of 35-300 bases remains a challenge. Single-molecule optical mapping 
technologies allow the analysis of DNA molecules of up to 2 Mb and as such are 
suitable for the identification of large-scale genome structural variations, and 
for de novo genome assemblies when combined with short-read NGS data. Here we 
present optical mapping data for two human genomes: the HapMap cell line GM12878 
and the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116.
FINDINGS: High molecular weight DNA was obtained by embedding GM12878 and HCT116 
cells, respectively, in agarose plugs, followed by DNA extraction under mild 
conditions. Genomic DNA was digested with KpnI and 310,000 and 296,000 DNA 
molecules (≥ 150 kb and 10 restriction fragments), respectively, were analyzed 
per cell line using the Argus optical mapping system. Maps were aligned to the 
human reference by OPTIMA, a new glocal alignment method. Genome coverage of 
6.8× and 5.7× was obtained, respectively; 2.9× and 1.7× more than the coverage 
obtained with previously available software.
CONCLUSIONS: Optical mapping allows the resolution of large-scale structural 
variations of the genome, and the scaffold extension of NGS-based de novo 
assemblies. OPTIMA is an efficient new alignment method; our optical mapping 
data provide a resource for genome structure analyses of the human HapMap 
reference cell line GM12878, and the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116.

Malassezia is a unique lipophilic genus in class Malasseziomycetes in 
Ustilaginomycotina, (Basidiomycota, fungi) that otherwise consists almost 
exclusively of plant pathogens. Malassezia are typically isolated from 
warm-blooded animals, are dominant members of the human skin mycobiome and are 
associated with common skin disorders. To characterize the genetic basis of the 
unique phenotypes of Malassezia spp., we sequenced the genomes of all 14 
accepted species and used comparative genomics against a broad panel of fungal 
genomes to comprehensively identify distinct features that define the Malassezia 
gene repertoire: gene gain and loss; selection signatures; and lineage-specific 
gene family expansions. Our analysis revealed key gene gain events (64) with a 
single gene conserved across all Malassezia but absent in all other sequenced 
Basidiomycota. These likely horizontally transferred genes provide intriguing 
gain-of-function events and prime candidates to explain the emergence of 
Malassezia. A larger set of genes (741) were lost, with enrichment for glycosyl 
hydrolases and carbohydrate metabolism, concordant with adaptation to skin's 
carbohydrate-deficient environment. Gene family analysis revealed extensive 
turnover and underlined the importance of secretory lipases, phospholipases, 
aspartyl proteases, and other peptidases. Combining genomic analysis with a 
re-evaluation of culture characteristics, we establish the likely 
lipid-dependence of all Malassezia. Our phylogenetic analysis sheds new light on 
the relationship between Malassezia and other members of Ustilaginomycotina, as 
well as phylogenetic lineages within the genus. Overall, our study provides a 
unique genomic resource for understanding Malassezia niche-specificity and 
potential virulence, as well as their abundance and distribution in the 
environment and on human skin.

High-grade serous cancer (HGSC) progresses to advanced stages without symptoms 
and the 5-year survival rate is a dismal 30%. Recent studies of ovaries and 
Fallopian tubes in patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations have documented a 
pre-metastatic intramucosal neoplasm that is found almost exclusively in the 
Fallopian tube, termed 'serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma' or STIC. 
Moreover, other proliferations, termed p53 signatures, secretory cell outgrowths 
(SCOUTs), and lower-grade serous tubal intraepithelial neoplasms (STINs) fall 
short of STIC but share similar alterations in expression, in keeping with an 
underpinning of genomic disturbances involved in, or occurring in parallel with, 
serous carcinogenesis. To gain insight into the cellular origins of this unique 
tubal pathway to high-grade serous cancer, we cloned and both immortalized and 
transformed Fallopian tube stem cells (FTSCs). We demonstrated that pedigrees of 
FTSCs were capable of multipotent differentiation and that the tumours derived 
from transformed FTSCs shared the histological and molecular features of HGSC. 
We also demonstrated that altered expression of some biomarkers seen in 
transformed FTSCs and HGSCs (stathmin, EZH2, CXCR4, CXCL12, and FOXM1) could be 
seen as well in immortalized cells and their in vivo counterparts SCOUTs and 
STINs. Thus, a whole-genome transcriptome analysis comparing FTSCs, immortalized 
FTSCs, and transformed FTSCs showed a clear molecular progression sequence that 
is recapitulated by the spectrum of accumulated perturbations characterizing the 
range of proliferations seen in vivo. Biomarkers unique to STIC relative to 
normal tubal epithelium provide a basis for novel detection approaches to early 
HGSC, but must be viewed critically given their potential expression in lesser

may provide unique early targets for prevention strategies. Central to these 
efforts has been the ability to clone and perpetuate multipotent FTSCs.

Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of lower respiratory 
tract infections in children ,2 years of age. Little is known about RSV 
intra-host genetic diversity over the course of infection or about the immune 
pressures that drive RSV molecular evolution. We performed whole-genome 
deep-sequencing on 53 RSV-positive samples (37 RSV subgroup A and 16 RSV 
subgroup B) collected from the upper airways of hospitalized children in 
southern Vietnam over two consecutive seasons. RSV A NA1 and RSV B BA9 were the 
predominant genotypes found in our samples, consistent with other reports on 
global RSV circulation during the same period. For both RSV A and B, the M gene 
was the most conserved, confirming its potential as a target for novel 
therapeutics. The G gene was the most variable and was the only gene under 
detectable positive selection. Further, positively selected sites inG were found 
in close proximity to and in some cases overlapped with predicted glycosylation 
motifs, suggesting that selection on amino acid glycosylation may drive viral 
genetic diversity. We further identified hotspots and coldspots of intra-host 
genetic diversity in the RSV genome, some of which may highlight previously 
unknown regions of functional importance.

Dengue viruses (DENV) cause debilitating and potentially life-threatening acute 
disease throughout the tropical world. While drug development efforts are 
underway, there are concerns that resistant strains will emerge rapidly. Indeed, 
antiviral drugs that target even conserved regions in other RNA viruses lose 
efficacy over time as the virus mutates. Here, we sought to determine if there 
are regions in the DENV genome that are not only evolutionarily conserved but 
genetically constrained in their ability to mutate and could hence serve as 
better antiviral targets. High-throughput sequencing of DENV-1 genome directly 
from twelve, paired dengue patients' sera and then passaging these sera into the 
two primary mosquito vectors showed consistent and distinct sequence changes 
during infection. In particular, two residues in the NS5 protein coding sequence 
appear to be specifically acquired during infection in Ae. aegypti but not Ae. 
albopictus. Importantly, we identified a region within the NS3 protein coding 
sequence that is refractory to mutation during human and mosquito infection. 
Collectively, these findings provide fresh insights into antiviral targets and 
could serve as an approach to defining evolutionarily constrained regions for 
therapeutic targeting in other RNA viruses.

Dengue virus (DENV) infection of an individual human or mosquito host produces a 
dynamic population of closely-related sequences. This intra-host genetic 
diversity is thought to offer an advantage for arboviruses to adapt as they 
cycle between two very different host species, but it remains poorly 
characterized. To track changes in viral intra-host genetic diversity during 
horizontal transmission, we infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes by allowing them 
to feed on DENV2-infected patients. We then performed whole-genome 
deep-sequencing of human- and matched mosquito-derived DENV samples on the 
Illumina platform and used a sensitive variant-caller to detect single 
nucleotide variants (SNVs) within each sample. >90% of SNVs were lost upon 
transition from human to mosquito, as well as from mosquito abdomen to salivary 
glands. Levels of viral diversity were maintained, however, by the regeneration 
of new SNVs at each stage of transmission. We further show that SNVs maintained 
across transmission stages were transmitted as a unit of two at maximum, 
suggesting the presence of numerous variant genomes carrying only one or two 
SNVs each. We also present evidence for differences in selection pressures 
between human and mosquito hosts, particularly on the structural and NS1 genes. 
This analysis provides insights into how population drops during transmission 
shape RNA virus genetic diversity, has direct implications for virus evolution, 
and illustrates the value of high-coverage, whole-genome next-generation 
sequencing for understanding viral intra-host genetic diversity.

Genome rearrangements, a hallmark of cancer, can result in gene fusions with 
oncogenic properties. Using DNA paired-end-tag (DNA-PET) whole-genome 
sequencing, we analyzed 15 gastric cancers (GCs) from Southeast Asians. 
Rearrangements were enriched in open chromatin and shaped by chromatin 
structure. We identified seven rearrangement hot spots and 136 gene fusions. In 
three out of 100 GC cases, we found recurrent fusions between CLDN18, a tight 
junction gene, and ARHGAP26, a gene encoding a RHOA inhibitor. Epithelial cell 
lines expressing CLDN18-ARHGAP26 displayed a dramatic loss of epithelial 
phenotype and long protrusions indicative of epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT). Fusion-positive cell lines showed impaired barrier properties, reduced 
cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion, retarded wound healing, and 
inhibition of RHOA. Gain of invasion was seen in cancer cell lines expressing 
the fusion. Thus, CLDN18-ARHGAP26 mediates epithelial disintegration, possibly 
leading to stomach H(+) leakage, and the fusion might contribute to invasiveness 
once a cell is transformed.

Stem cells of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver and other columnar 
epithelia collectively resist cloning in their elemental states. Here we 
demonstrate the cloning and propagation of highly clonogenic, 'ground state' 
stem cells of the human intestine and colon. We show that derived stem-cell 
pedigrees sustain limited copy number and sequence variation despite extensive 
serial passaging and display exquisitely precise, cell-autonomous commitment to 
epithelial differentiation consistent with their origins along the intestinal 
tract. This developmentally patterned and epigenetically maintained commitment 
of stem cells is likely to enforce the functional specificity of the adult 
intestinal tract. Using clonally derived colonic epithelia, we show that toxins 
A or B of the enteric pathogen Clostridium difficile recapitulate the salient 
features of pseudomembranous colitis. The stability of the epigenetic commitment 
programs of these stem cells, coupled with their unlimited replicative expansion 
and maintained clonogenicity, suggests certain advantages for their use in 
disease modelling and regenerative medicine.

The detection of somatic mutations from cancer genome sequences is key to 
understanding the genetic basis of disease progression, patient survival and 
response to therapy. Benchmarking is needed for tool assessment and improvement 
but is complicated by a lack of gold standards, by extensive resource 
requirements and by difficulties in sharing personal genomic information. To 
resolve these issues, we launched the ICGC-TCGA DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling 
Challenge, a crowdsourced benchmark of somatic mutation detection algorithms. 
Here we report the BAMSurgeon tool for simulating cancer genomes and the results 
of 248 analyses of three in silico tumors created with it. Different algorithms 
exhibit characteristic error profiles, and, intriguingly, false positives show a 
trinucleotide profile very similar to one found in human tumors. Although the 
three simulated tumors differ in sequence contamination (deviation from normal 
cell sequence) and in subclonality, an ensemble of pipelines outperforms the 
best individual pipeline in all cases. BAMSurgeon is available at 
https://github.com/adamewing/bamsurgeon/.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer with metastases limited to the liver 
(liver-limited mCRC) is a distinct clinical subset characterized by possible 
cure with surgery. We performed high-depth sequencing of over 750 
cancer-associated genes and copy number profiling in matched primary, metastasis 
and normal tissues to characterize genomic progression in 18 patients with 
liver-limited mCRC.
RESULTS: High depth Illumina sequencing and use of three different variant 
callers enable comprehensive and accurate identification of somatic variants 
down to 2.5% variant allele frequency. We identify a median of 11 somatic single 
nucleotide variants (SNVs) per tumor. Across patients, a median of 79.3% of 
somatic SNVs present in the primary are present in the metastasis and 81.7% of 
all alterations present in the metastasis are present in the primary. Private 
alterations are found at lower allele frequencies; a different mutational 
signature characterized shared and private variants, suggesting distinct 
mutational processes. Using B-allele frequencies of heterozygous germline SNPs 
and copy number profiling, we find that broad regions of allelic imbalance and 
focal copy number changes, respectively, are generally shared between the 
primary tumor and metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses point to high genomic concordance of primary tumor and 
metastasis, with a thick common trunk and smaller genomic branches in general 
support of the linear progression model in most patients with liver-limited 
mCRC. More extensive studies are warranted to further characterize genomic 
progression in this important clinical population.

Extensive and multi-dimensional data sets generated from recent cancer omics 
profiling projects have presented new challenges and opportunities for 
unraveling the complexity of cancer genome landscapes. In particular, 
distinguishing the unique complement of genes that drive tumorigenesis in each 
patient from a sea of passenger mutations is necessary for translating the full 
benefit of cancer genome sequencing into the clinic. We address this need by 
presenting a data integration framework (OncoIMPACT) to nominate 
patient-specific driver genes based on their phenotypic impact. Extensive in 
silico and in vitro validation helped establish OncoIMPACT's robustness, 
improved precision over competing approaches and verifiable patient and cell 
line specific predictions (2/2 and 6/7 true positives and negatives, 
respectively). In particular, we computationally predicted and experimentally 
validated the gene TRIM24 as a putative novel amplified driver in a melanoma 
patient. Applying OncoIMPACT to more than 1000 tumor samples, we generated 
patient-specific driver gene lists in five different cancer types to identify 
modes of synergistic action. We also provide the first demonstration that 
computationally derived driver mutation signatures can be overall superior to 
single gene and gene expression based signatures in enabling patient 
stratification and prognostication. Source code and executables for OncoIMPACT 
are freely available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/oncoimpact.

The importance of study design for detecting differentially abundant features in 
high-throughput experiments.

Luo H, Li J, Chia BK, Robson P, Nagarajan N.

High-throughput assays, such as RNA-seq, to detect differential abundance are 
widely used. Variable performance across statistical tests, normalizations, and 
conditions leads to resource wastage and reduced sensitivity. EDDA represents a 
first, general design tool for RNA-seq, Nanostring, and metagenomic analysis, 
that rationally selects tests, predicts performance, and plans experiments to 
minimize resource wastage. Case studies highlight EDDA's ability to model 
single-cell RNA-seq, suggesting ways to reduce sequencing costs up to five-fold 
and improving metagenomic biomarker detection through improved test selection. 
EDDA's novel mode-based normalization for detecting differential abundance 
improves robustness by 10% to 20% and precision by up to 140%.

reads.

We present a method for obtaining long haplotypes, of over 3 kb in length, using 
a short-read sequencer, Barcode-directed Assembly for Extra-long Sequences 
(BAsE-Seq). BAsE-Seq relies on transposing a template-specific barcode onto 
random segments of the template molecule and assembling the barcoded short reads 
into complete haplotypes. We applied BAsE-Seq on mixed clones of hepatitis B 
virus and accurately identified haplotypes occurring at frequencies greater than 
or equal to 0.4%, with >99.9% specificity. Applying BAsE-Seq to a clinical 
sample, we obtained over 9,000 viral haplotypes, which provided an unprecedented 
view of hepatitis B virus population structure during chronic infection. 
BAsE-Seq is readily applicable for monitoring quasispecies evolution in viral 
diseases.

Chromosomal structural variations play an important role in determining the 
transcriptional landscape of human breast cancers. To assess the nature of these 
structural variations, we analyzed eight breast tumor samples with a focus on 
regions of gene amplification using mate-pair sequencing of long-insert genomic 
DNA with matched transcriptome profiling. We found that tandem duplications 
appear to be early events in tumor evolution, especially in the genesis of 
amplicons. In a detailed reconstruction of events on chromosome 17, we found 
large unpaired inversions and deletions connect a tandemly duplicated ERBB2 with 
neighboring 17q21.3 amplicons while simultaneously deleting the intervening 
BRCA1 tumor suppressor locus. This series of events appeared to be unusually 
common when examined in larger genomic data sets of breast cancers albeit using 
approaches with lesser resolution. Using siRNAs in breast cancer cell lines, we 
showed that the 17q21.3 amplicon harbored a significant number of weak oncogenes 
that appeared consistently coamplified in primary tumors. Down-regulation of 
BRCA1 expression augmented the cell proliferation in ERBB2-transfected human 
normal mammary epithelial cells. Coamplification of other functionally tested 
oncogenic elements in other breast tumors examined, such as RIPK2 and MYC on 
chromosome 8, also parallel these findings. Our analyses suggest that structural 
variations efficiently orchestrate the gain and loss of cancer gene cassettes 
that engage many oncogenic pathways simultaneously and that such oncogenic 
cassettes are favored during the evolution of a cancer.

Fastidious anaerobic bacteria play critical roles in environmental 
bioremediation of halogenated compounds. However, their characterization and 
application have been largely impeded by difficulties in growing them in pure 
culture. Thus far, no pure culture has been reported to respire on the notorious 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and functional genes responsible for PCB 
detoxification remain unknown due to the extremely slow growth of PCB-respiring 
bacteria. Here we report the successful isolation and characterization of three 
Dehalococcoides mccartyi strains that respire on commercial PCBs. Using 
high-throughput metagenomic analysis, combined with traditional culture 
techniques, tetrachloroethene (PCE) was identified as a feasible alternative to 
PCBs to isolate PCB-respiring Dehalococcoides from PCB-enriched cultures. With 
PCE as an alternative electron acceptor, the PCB-respiring Dehalococcoides were 
boosted to a higher cell density (1.2 × 10(8) to 1.3 × 10(8) cells per mL on PCE 
vs. 5.9 × 10(6) to 10.4 × 10(6) cells per mL on PCBs) with a shorter culturing 
time (30 d on PCE vs. 150 d on PCBs). The transcriptomic profiles illustrated 
that the distinct PCB dechlorination profile of each strain was predominantly 
mediated by a single, novel reductive dehalogenase (RDase) catalyzing chlorine 
removal from both PCBs and PCE. The transcription levels of PCB-RDase genes are 
5-60 times higher than the genome-wide average. The cultivation of PCB-respiring 
Dehalococcoides in pure culture and the identification of PCB-RDase genes deepen 
our understanding of organohalide respiration of PCBs and shed light on in situ 
PCB bioremediation.

Opisthorchiasis is a neglected, tropical disease caused by the carcinogenic 
Asian liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini. This hepatobiliary disease is linked 
to malignant cancer (cholangiocarcinoma, CCA) and affects millions of people in 
Asia. No vaccine is available, and only one drug (praziquantel) is used against 
the parasite. Little is known about O. viverrini biology and the diseases that 
it causes. Here we characterize the draft genome (634.5 Mb) and transcriptomes 
of O. viverrini, elucidate how this fluke survives in the hostile environment 
within the bile duct and show that metabolic pathways in the parasite are highly 
adapted to a lipid-rich diet from bile and/or cholangiocytes. We also provide 
additional evidence that O. viverrini and other flukes secrete proteins that 
directly modulate host cell proliferation. Our molecular resources now underpin 
profound explorations of opisthorchiasis/CCA and the design of new 
interventions.

RNA viruses are notorious for their ability to quickly adapt to selective 
pressure from the host immune system and/or antivirals. This adaptability is 
likely due to the error-prone characteristics of their RNA-dependent, RNA 
polymerase [1, 2]. Dengue virus, a member of the Flaviviridae family of 
positive-strand RNA viruses, is also known to share these error-prone 
characteristics [3]. Utilizing high-throughput, massively parallel sequencing 
methodologies, or next-generation sequencing (NGS), we can now accurately 
quantify these populations of viruses and track the changes to these populations 
over the course of a single infection. The aim of this chapter is twofold: to 
describe the methodologies required for sample preparation prior to sequencing 
and to describe the bioinformatics analyses required for the resulting data.

The high throughput and cost-effectiveness afforded by short-read sequencing 
technologies, in principle, enable researchers to perform 16S rRNA profiling of 
complex microbial communities at unprecedented depth and resolution. Existing 
Illumina sequencing protocols are, however, limited by the fraction of the 16S 
rRNA gene that is interrogated and therefore limit the resolution and quality of 
the profiling. To address this, we present the design of a novel protocol for 
shotgun Illumina sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, optimized to amplify 
more than 90% of sequences in the Greengenes database and with the ability to 
distinguish nearly twice as many species-level OTUs compared to existing 
protocols. Using several in silico and experimental datasets, we demonstrate 
that despite the presence of multiple variable and conserved regions, the 
resulting shotgun sequences can be used to accurately quantify the constituents 
of complex microbial communities. The reconstruction of a significant fraction 
of the 16S rRNA gene also enabled high precision (>90%) in species-level 
identification thereby opening up potential application of this approach for 
clinical microbial characterization.

Advances in sequencing technologies and increased access to sequencing services 
have led to renewed interest in sequence and genome assembly. Concurrently, new 
applications for sequencing have emerged, including gene expression analysis, 
discovery of genomic variants and metagenomics, and each of these has different 
needs and challenges in terms of assembly. We survey the theoretical foundations 
that underlie modern assembly and highlight the options and practical trade-offs 
that need to be considered, focusing on how individual features address the 
needs of specific applications. We also review key software and the interplay 
between experimental design and efficacy of assembly.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is the second highest cause of global cancer 
mortality. To explore the complete repertoire of somatic alterations in gastric 
cancer, we combined massively parallel short read and DNA paired-end tag 
sequencing to present the first whole-genome analysis of two gastric 
adenocarcinomas, one with chromosomal instability and the other with 
microsatellite instability.
RESULTS: Integrative analysis and de novo assemblies revealed the architecture 
of a wild-type KRAS amplification, a common driver event in gastric cancer. We 
discovered three distinct mutational signatures in gastric cancer--against a 
genome-wide backdrop of oxidative and microsatellite instability-related 
mutational signatures, we identified the first exome-specific mutational 
signature. Further characterization of the impact of these signatures by 
combining sequencing data from 40 complete gastric cancer exomes and targeted 
screening of an additional 94 independent gastric tumors uncovered ACVR2A, RPL22 
and LMAN1 as recurrently mutated genes in microsatellite instability-positive 
gastric cancer and PAPPA as a recurrently mutated gene in TP53 wild-type gastric 
cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight how whole-genome cancer sequencing can 
uncover information relevant to tissue-specific carcinogenesis that would 
otherwise be missed from exome-sequencing data.

Oranges are an important nutritional source for human health and have immense 
economic value. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the draft genome of 
sweet orange (Citrus sinensis). The assembled sequence covers 87.3% of the 
estimated orange genome, which is relatively compact, as 20% is composed of 
repetitive elements. We predicted 29,445 protein-coding genes, half of which are 
in the heterozygous state. With additional sequencing of two more citrus species 
and comparative analyses of seven citrus genomes, we present evidence to suggest 
that sweet orange originated from a backcross hybrid between pummelo and 
mandarin. Focused analysis on genes involved in vitamin C metabolism showed that 
GalUR, encoding the rate-limiting enzyme of the galacturonate pathway, is 
significantly upregulated in orange fruit, and the recent expansion of this gene 
family may provide a genomic basis. This draft genome represents a valuable 
resource for understanding and improving many important citrus traits in the 
future.

The study of cell-population heterogeneity in a range of biological systems, 
from viruses to bacterial isolates to tumor samples, has been transformed by 
recent advances in sequencing throughput. While the high-coverage afforded can 
be used, in principle, to identify very rare variants in a population, existing 
ad hoc approaches frequently fail to distinguish true variants from sequencing 
errors. We report a method (LoFreq) that models sequencing run-specific error 
rates to accurately call variants occurring in <0.05% of a population. Using 
simulated and real datasets (viral, bacterial and human), we show that LoFreq 
has near-perfect specificity, with significantly improved sensitivity compared 
with existing methods and can efficiently analyze deep Illumina sequencing 
datasets without resorting to approximations or heuristics. We also present 
experimental validation for LoFreq on two different platforms (Fluidigm and 
Sequenom) and its application to call rare somatic variants from exome 
sequencing datasets for gastric cancer. Source code and executables for LoFreq 
are freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/lofreq/.

Structural variations (SVs) contribute significantly to the variability of the 
human genome and extensive genomic rearrangements are a hallmark of cancer. 
While genomic DNA paired-end-tag (DNA-PET) sequencing is an attractive approach 
to identify genomic SVs, the current application of PET sequencing with short 
insert size DNA can be insufficient for the comprehensive mapping of SVs in low 
complexity and repeat-rich genomic regions. We employed a recently developed 
procedure to generate PET sequencing data using large DNA inserts of 10-20 kb 
and compared their characteristics with short insert (1 kb) libraries for their 
ability to identify SVs. Our results suggest that although short insert 
libraries bear an advantage in identifying small deletions, they do not provide 
significantly better breakpoint resolution. In contrast, large inserts are 
superior to short inserts in providing higher physical genome coverage for the 
same sequencing cost and achieve greater sensitivity, in practice, for the 
identification of several classes of SVs, such as copy number neutral and 
complex events. Furthermore, our results confirm that large insert libraries 
allow for the identification of SVs within repetitive sequences, which cannot be 
spanned by short inserts. This provides a key advantage in studying 
rearrangements in cancer, and we show how it can be used in a 
fusion-point-guided-concatenation algorithm to study focally amplified regions 
in cancer.

BACKGROUND: Dengue is the most common arboviral infection of humans. There are 
currently no specific treatments for dengue. Balapiravir is a prodrug of a 
nucleoside analogue (called R1479) and an inhibitor of hepatitis C virus 
replication in vivo.
METHODS: We conducted in vitro experiments to determine the potency of 
balapiravir against dengue viruses and then an exploratory, dose-escalating, 
randomized placebo-controlled trial in adult male patients with dengue with <48 
hours of fever.
RESULTS: The clinical and laboratory adverse event profile in patients receiving 
balapiravir at doses of 1500 mg (n = 10) or 3000 mg (n = 22) orally for 5 days 
was similar to that of patients receiving placebo (n = 32), indicating 
balapiravir was well tolerated. However, twice daily assessment of viremia and 
daily assessment of NS1 antigenemia indicated balapiravir did not measurably 
alter the kinetics of these virological markers, nor did it reduce the fever 
clearance time. The kinetics of plasma cytokine concentrations and the whole 
blood transcriptional profile were also not attenuated by balapiravir treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Although this trial, the first of its kind in dengue, does not 
support balapiravir as a candidate drug, it does establish a framework for 
antiviral treatment trials in dengue and provides the field with a clinically 
evaluated benchmark molecule.

We describe genome mapping on nanochannel arrays. In this approach, specific 
sequence motifs in single DNA molecules are fluorescently labeled, and the DNA 
molecules are uniformly stretched in thousands of silicon channels on a 
nanofluidic device. Fluorescence imaging allows the construction of maps of the 
physical distances between occurrences of the sequence motifs. We demonstrate 
the analysis, individually and as mixtures, of 95 bacterial artificial 
chromosome (BAC) clones that cover the 4.7-Mb human major histocompatibility 
complex region. We obtain accurate, haplotype-resolved, sequence motif maps 
hundreds of kilobases in length, resulting in a median coverage of 114× for the 
BACs. The final sequence motif map assembly contains three contigs. With an 
average distance of 9 kb between labels, we detect 22 haplotype differences. We 
also use the sequence motif maps to provide scaffolds for de novo assembly of 
sequencing data. Nanochannel genome mapping should facilitate de novo assembly 
of sequencing reads from complex regions in diploid organisms, haplotype and 
structural variation analysis and comparative genomics.

Gastric cancer is a major cause of global cancer mortality. We surveyed the 
spectrum of somatic alterations in gastric cancer by sequencing the exomes of 15 
gastric adenocarcinomas and their matched normal DNAs. Frequently mutated genes 
in the adenocarcinomas included TP53 (11/15 tumors), PIK3CA (3/15) and ARID1A 
(3/15). Cell adhesion was the most enriched biological pathway among the 
frequently mutated genes. A prevalence screening confirmed mutations in FAT4, a 
cadherin family gene, in 5% of gastric cancers (6/110) and FAT4 genomic 
deletions in 4% (3/83) of gastric tumors. Frequent mutations in chromatin 
remodeling genes (ARID1A, MLL3 and MLL) also occurred in 47% of the gastric 
cancers. We detected ARID1A mutations in 8% of tumors (9/110), which were 
associated with concurrent PIK3CA mutations and microsatellite instability. In 
functional assays, we observed both FAT4 and ARID1A to exert tumor-suppressor 
activity. Somatic inactivation of FAT4 and ARID1A may thus be key tumorigenic 
events in a subset of gastric cancers.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) elicit high response rates among individuals 
with kinase-driven malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 
epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (EGFR 
NSCLC). However, the extent and duration of these responses are heterogeneous, 
suggesting the existence of genetic modifiers affecting an individual's response 
to TKIs. Using paired-end DNA sequencing, we discovered a common intronic 
deletion polymorphism in the gene encoding BCL2-like 11 (BIM). BIM is a 
pro-apoptotic member of the B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family of proteins, and 
its upregulation is required for TKIs to induce apoptosis in kinase-driven 
cancers. The polymorphism switched BIM splicing from exon 4 to exon 3, which 
resulted in expression of BIM isoforms lacking the pro-apoptotic BCL2-homology 
domain 3 (BH3). The polymorphism was sufficient to confer intrinsic TKI 
resistance in CML and EGFR NSCLC cell lines, but this resistance could be 
overcome with BH3-mimetic drugs. Notably, individuals with CML and EGFR NSCLC 
harboring the polymorphism experienced significantly inferior responses to TKIs 
than did individuals without the polymorphism (P = 0.02 for CML and P = 0.027 
for EGFR NSCLC). Our results offer an explanation for the heterogeneity of TKI 
responses across individuals and suggest the possibility of personalizing 
therapy with BH3 mimetics to overcome BIM-polymorphism-associated TKI 
resistance.

Scaffolding, the problem of ordering and orienting contigs, typically using 
paired-end reads, is a crucial step in the assembly of high-quality draft 
genomes. Even as sequencing technologies and mate-pair protocols have improved 
significantly, scaffolding programs still rely on heuristics, with no guarantees 
on the quality of the solution. In this work, we explored the feasibility of an 
exact solution for scaffolding and present a first tractable solution for this 
problem (Opera). We also describe a graph contraction procedure that allows the 
solution to scale to large scaffolding problems and demonstrate this by 
scaffolding several large real and synthetic datasets. In comparisons with 
existing scaffolders, Opera simultaneously produced longer and more accurate 
scaffolds demonstrating the utility of an exact approach. Opera also 
incorporates an exact quadratic programming formulation to precisely compute gap 
sizes (Availability: http://sourceforge.net/projects/operasf/ ).

Somatic genome rearrangements are thought to play important roles in cancer 
development. We optimized a long-span paired-end-tag (PET) sequencing approach 
using 10-Kb genomic DNA inserts to study human genome structural variations 
(SVs). The use of a 10-Kb insert size allows the identification of breakpoints 
within repetitive or homology-containing regions of a few kilobases in size and 
results in a higher physical coverage compared with small insert libraries with 
the same sequencing effort. We have applied this approach to comprehensively 
characterize the SVs of 15 cancer and two noncancer genomes and used a filtering 
approach to strongly enrich for somatic SVs in the cancer genomes. Our analyses 
revealed that most inversions, deletions, and insertions are germ-line SVs, 
whereas tandem duplications, unpaired inversions, interchromosomal 
translocations, and complex rearrangements are over-represented among somatic 
rearrangements in cancer genomes. We demonstrate that the quantitative and 
connective nature of DNA-PET data is precise in delineating the genealogy of 
complex rearrangement events, we observe signatures that are compatible with 
breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, and we discover that large duplications are among 
the initial rearrangements that trigger genome instability for extensive 
amplification in epithelial cancers.

Reassortments in the influenza virus--a process where strains exchange genetic 
segments--have been implicated in two out of three pandemics of the 20th century 
as well as the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. While advances in sequencing have led to an 
explosion in the number of whole-genome sequences that are available, an 
understanding of the rate and distribution of reassortments and their role in 
viral evolution is still lacking. An important factor in this is the paucity of 
automated tools for confident identification of reassortments from sequence data 
due to the challenges of analyzing large, uncertain viral phylogenies. We 
describe here a novel computational method, called GiRaF 
(Graph-incompatibility-based Reassortment Finder), that robustly identifies 
reassortments in a fully automated fashion while accounting for uncertainties in 
the inferred phylogenies. The algorithms behind GiRaF search large collections 
of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-sampled trees for groups of incompatible 
splits using a fast biclique enumeration algorithm coupled with several 
statistical tests to identify sets of taxa with differential phylogenetic 
placement. GiRaF correctly finds known reassortments in human, avian, and swine 
influenza populations, including the evolutionary events that led to the recent 
'swine flu' outbreak. GiRaF also identifies several previously unreported 
reassortments via whole-genome studies to catalog events in H5N1 and swine 
influenza isolates.

Several sequencing technologies have been introduced in recent years that 
dramatically outperform the traditional Sanger technology in terms of throughput 
and cost. The data generated by these technologies are characterized by 
generally shorter read lengths (as low as 35 bp) and different error 
characteristics than Sanger data. Existing software tools for assembly and 
analysis of sequencing data are, therefore, ill-suited to handle the new types 
of data generated. This paper surveys the recent software packages aimed 
specifically at analyzing new generation sequencing data.

While new sequencing technologies have ushered in an era where microbial genomes 
can be easily sequenced, the goal of routinely producing high-quality draft and 
finished genomes in a cost-effective fashion has still remained elusive. Due to 
shorter read lengths and limitations in library construction protocols, shotgun 
sequencing and assembly based on these technologies often results in fragmented 
assemblies. Correspondingly, while draft assemblies can be obtained in days, 
finishing can take many months and hence the time and effort can only be 
justified for high-priority genomes and in large sequencing centers. In this 
work, we revisit this issue in light of our own experience in producing finished 
and nearly-finished genomes for a range of microbial species in a small-lab 
setting. These genomes were finished with surprisingly little investments in 
terms of time, computational effort and lab work, suggesting that the increased 
access to sequencing might also eventually lead to a greater proportion of 
finished genomes from small labs and genomics cores.

Hierarchical clustering is a popular method for grouping together similar 
elements based on a distance measure between them. In many cases, annotations 
for some elements are known beforehand, which can aid the clustering process. We 
present a novel approach for decomposing a hierarchical clustering into the 
clusters that optimally match a set of known annotations, as measured by the 
variation of information metric. Our approach is general and does not require 
the user to enter the number of clusters desired. We apply it to two biological 
domains: finding protein complexes within protein interaction networks and 
identifying species within metagenomic DNA samples. For these two applications, 
we test the quality of our clusters by using them to predict complex and species 
membership, respectively. We find that our approach generally outperforms the 
commonly used heuristic methods.

BACKGROUND: Molecular studies of microbial diversity have provided many insights 
into the bacterial communities inhabiting the human body and the environment. A 
common first step in such studies is a survey of conserved marker genes 
(primarily 16S rRNA) to characterize the taxonomic composition and diversity of 
these communities. To date, however, there exists significant variability in 
analysis methods employed in these studies.
RESULTS: Here we provide a critical assessment of current analysis methodologies 
that cluster sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and demonstrate 
that small changes in algorithm parameters can lead to significantly varying 
results. Our analysis provides strong evidence that the species-level diversity 
estimates produced using common OTU methodologies are inflated due to overly 
stringent parameter choices. We further describe an example of how 
semi-supervised clustering can produce OTUs that are more robust to changes in 
algorithm parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the need for systematic and open evaluation 
of data analysis methodologies, especially as targeted 16S rRNA diversity 
studies are increasingly relying on high-throughput sequencing technologies. All 
data and results from our study are available through the JGI FAMeS website 
http://fames.jgi-psf.org/.

BACKGROUND: New DNA sequencing technologies have enabled detailed comparative 
genomic analyses of entire genera of bacterial pathogens. Prior to this study, 
three species of the enterobacterial genus Yersinia that cause invasive human 
diseases (Yersinia pestis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Yersinia 
enterocolitica) had been sequenced. However, there were no genomic data on the 
Yersinia species with more limited virulence potential, frequently found in soil 
and water environments.
RESULTS: We used high-throughput sequencing-by-synthesis instruments to obtain 
25- to 42-fold average redundancy, whole-genome shotgun data from the type 
strains of eight species: Y. aldovae, Y. bercovieri, Y. frederiksenii, Y. 
kristensenii, Y. intermedia, Y. mollaretii, Y. rohdei, and Y. ruckeri. The 
deepest branching species in the genus, Y. ruckeri, causative agent of red mouth 
disease in fish, has the smallest genome (3.7 Mb), although it shares the same 
core set of approximately 2,500 genes as the other members of the species, whose 
genomes range in size from 4.3 to 4.8 Mb. Yersinia genomes had a similar global 
partition of protein functions, as measured by the distribution of Cluster of 
Orthologous Groups families. Genome to genome variation in islands with genes 
encoding functions such as ureases, hydrogenases and B-12 cofactor metabolite 
reactions may reflect adaptations to colonizing specific host habitats.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid high-quality draft sequencing was used successfully to 
compare pathogenic and non-pathogenic members of the Yersinia genus. This work 
underscores the importance of the acquisition of horizontally transferred genes 
in the evolution of Y. pestis and points to virulence determinants that have 
been gained and lost on multiple occasions in the history of the genus.

BACKGROUND: In April 2009, novel swine-origin influenza viruses (S-OIV) were 
identified in patients from Mexico and the United States. The viruses were 
genetically characterized as a novel influenza A (H1N1) strain originating in 
swine, and within a very short time the S-OIV strain spread across the globe via 
human-to-human contact.
METHODOLOGY: We conducted a comprehensive computational search of all available 
sequences of the surface proteins of H1N1 swine influenza isolates and found 
that a similar strain to S-OIV appeared in Thailand in 2000. The earlier 
isolates caused infections in pigs but only one sequenced human case, 
A/Thailand/271/2005 (H1N1).
SIGNIFICANCE: Differences between the Thai cases and S-OIV may help shed light 
on the ability of the current outbreak strain to spread rapidly among humans.

Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742, USA.

In recent years, a flurry of new DNA sequencing technologies have altered the 
landscape of genomics, providing a vast amount of sequence information at a 
fraction of the costs that were previously feasible. The task of assembling 
these sequences into a genome has, however, still remained an algorithmic 
challenge that is in practice answered by heuristic solutions. In order to 
design better assembly algorithms and exploit the characteristics of sequence 
data from new technologies, we need an improved understanding of the parametric 
complexity of the assembly problem. In this article, we provide a first 
theoretical study in this direction, exploring the connections between repeat 
complexity, read lengths, overlap lengths and coverage in determining the "hard" 
instances of the assembly problem. Our work suggests at least two ways in which 
existing assemblers can be extended in a rigorous fashion, in addition to 
delineating directions for future theoretical investigations.

Numerous studies are currently underway to characterize the microbial 
communities inhabiting our world. These studies aim to dramatically expand our 
understanding of the microbial biosphere and, more importantly, hope to reveal 
the secrets of the complex symbiotic relationship between us and our commensal 
bacterial microflora. An important prerequisite for such discoveries are 
computational tools that are able to rapidly and accurately compare large 
datasets generated from complex bacterial communities to identify features that 
distinguish them.We present a statistical method for comparing clinical 
metagenomic samples from two treatment populations on the basis of count data 
(e.g. as obtained through sequencing) to detect differentially abundant 
features. Our method, Metastats, employs the false discovery rate to improve 
specificity in high-complexity environments, and separately handles 
sparsely-sampled features using Fisher's exact test. Under a variety of 
simulations, we show that Metastats performs well compared to previously used 
methods, and significantly outperforms other methods for features with sparse 
counts. We demonstrate the utility of our method on several datasets including a 
16S rRNA survey of obese and lean human gut microbiomes, COG functional profiles 
of infant and mature gut microbiomes, and bacterial and viral metabolic 
subsystem data inferred from random sequencing of 85 metagenomes. The 
application of our method to the obesity dataset reveals differences between 
obese and lean subjects not reported in the original study. For the COG and 
subsystem datasets, we provide the first statistically rigorous assessment of 
the differences between these populations. The methods described in this paper 
are the first to address clinical metagenomic datasets comprising samples from 
multiple subjects. Our methods are robust across datasets of varied complexity 
and sampling level. While designed for metagenomic applications, our software 
can also be applied to digital gene expression studies (e.g. SAGE). A web server 
implementation of our methods and freely available source code can be found at

Papaya, a fruit crop cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions, is known 
for its nutritional benefits and medicinal applications. Here we report a 3x 
draft genome sequence of 'SunUp' papaya, the first commercial virus-resistant 
transgenic fruit tree to be sequenced. The papaya genome is three times the size 
of the Arabidopsis genome, but contains fewer genes, including significantly 
fewer disease-resistance gene analogues. Comparison of the five sequenced 
genomes suggests a minimal angiosperm gene set of 13,311. A lack of recent 
genome duplication, atypical of other angiosperm genomes sequenced so far, may 
account for the smaller papaya gene number in most functional groups. 
Nonetheless, striking amplifications in gene number within particular functional 
groups suggest roles in the evolution of tree-like habit, deposition and 
remobilization of starch reserves, attraction of seed dispersal agents, and 
adaptation to tropical daylengths. Transgenesis at three locations is closely 
associated with chloroplast insertions into the nuclear genome, and with 
topoisomerase I recognition sites. Papaya offers numerous advantages as a system 
for fruit-tree functional genomics, and this draft genome sequence provides the 
foundation for revealing the basis of Carica's distinguishing 
morpho-physiological, medicinal and nutritional properties.

Scaffolding and validation of bacterial genome assemblies using optical 
restriction maps.

MOTIVATION: New, high-throughput sequencing technologies have made it feasible 
to cheaply generate vast amounts of sequence information from a genome of 
interest. The computational reconstruction of the complete sequence of a genome 
is complicated by specific features of these new sequencing technologies, such 
as the short length of the sequencing reads and absence of mate-pair 
information. In this article we propose methods to overcome such limitations by 
incorporating information from optical restriction maps.
RESULTS: We demonstrate the robustness of our methods to sequencing and assembly 
errors using extensive experiments on simulated datasets. We then present the 
results obtained by applying our algorithms to data generated from two bacterial 
genomes Yersinia aldovae and Yersinia kristensenii. The resulting assemblies 
contain a single scaffold covering a large fraction of the respective genomes, 
suggesting that the careful use of optical maps can provide a cost-effective 
framework for the assembly of genomes.

FAST: Fourier transform based algorithms for significance testing of ungapped 
multiple alignments.

SUMMARY: As was shown in Nagarajan et al. (2005), commonly used approximations 
for assessing the significance of multiple alignments can be be very inaccurate. 
To address this, we present here the FAST package, an open-source collection of 
programs and libraries for efficiently and reliably computing the significance 
of ungapped local alignments. We also describe other potential applications in 
Bioinformatics where these programs can be adapted for significance testing.
AVAILABILITY: The FAST package includes C++ implementations of various 
algorithms that can be used as stand-alone programs or as a library of 
subroutines. The package and a web-server for some of the programs are available 
at www.cs.cornell.edu/~keich/FAST.

MOTIVATION: Effective algorithms for finding relatively weak motifs are an 
important practical necessity while scanning long DNA sequences for regulatory 
elements. The success of such an algorithm hinges on the ability of its scoring 
function combined with a significance analysis test to discern real motifs from 
random noise.
RESULTS: In the first half of the paper we show that the paradigm of relying on 
entropy scores and their E-values can lead to undesirable results when searching 
for weak motifs and we offer alternate approaches to analyzing the significance 
of motifs. In the second half of the paper we reintroduce a scoring function and 
present a motif-finder that optimizes it that are more effective in finding 
relatively weak motifs than other tools.

MOTIVATION: The efficient and accurate computation of P-values is an essential 
requirement for motif-finding and alignment tools. We show that the 
approximation algorithms used in two popular motif-finding programs, MEME and 
Consensus, can fail to accurately compute the P-value.
RESULTS: We present two new algorithms: one for the evaluation of the P-values 
of a range of motif scores, and a faster one for the evaluation of the P-value 
of a single motif score. Both exhibit more reliability than existing algorithms, 
and the latter algorithm is comparable in speed to the fastest existing method.

learning system.

MOTIVATION: We describe a novel method for detecting the domain structure of a 
protein from sequence information alone. The method is based on analyzing 
multiple sequence alignments that are derived from a database search. Multiple 
measures are defined to quantify the domain information content of each position 
along the sequence and are combined into a single predictor using a neural 
network. The output is further smoothed and post-processed using a probabilistic 
model to predict the most likely transition positions between domains.
RESULTS: The method was assessed using the domain definitions in SCOP and CATH 
for proteins of known structure and was compared with several other existing 
methods. Our method performs well both in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. It 
improves significantly over the best methods available, even some of the 
semi-manual ones, while being fully automatic. Our method can also be used to 
suggest and verify domain partitions based on structural data. A few examples of 
predicted domain definitions and alternative partitions, as suggested by our 
method, are also discussed.
